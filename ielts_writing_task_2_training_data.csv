1,"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In the present age, whether museums serve best as entertainment centers or whether they are best left as places of education has sparked much debate. In this essay I will present both views and shall state my opinion as well.

Firstly, entertaining museums are more monetarily successful. Strictly speaking, if an attraction is more geared towards amusing its visitors instead of teaching them it will be more popular. This is just a fact of nature, because learning new information is much more difficult when compared to entertainment, which requires no thought. Larger profits mean a larger influence, economically and socially, which are all huge feathers in amusing museums’ cap. So, pleasurable museums continuously earn more than scholarly ones and thus, have more options, more influence and have a greater impact on the economy.

	Secondly, uninformative museums can become relevant more frequently and stay so longer. Museums which are delightful and enjoyable can change their programs and exhibits, while solemn and academic institutions cannot afford to do it frequently, if at all. Because education is not their main priority, delightful museums can create new, spectacular exhibits without worrying about changing or losing their educational value. This is a huge benefit, which allows for these establishments to stay relevant and attract new customers more easily. Once a person has been to an instructional museum, they have little to no incentive to return, which reduces the amount of customers that this kind of museum can take in. The harm of this effect is opposite to the benefits of a bigger profit. Henceforth, amusing museums receive more return customers and thus, larger profits than academic museums.

	However, enlightening museums are more beneficial to society. This kind of museum’s purpose is to preserve past artifacts and to teach willing people their history and importance. This is important because the past must be preserved and museums can be host to direct sources, from which history is told today. Museums come in many different form factors, but their main goal is the same: to inform the public through various means. Museums don’t need to be entertaining to serve this purpose, because there are other places to seek amusement. Were museums to abandon their mission in order to seek a larger profit, they would lose their purpose and niche, while gaining significant competition in the entertainment industry. Museums can be entertaining and informative at the same time, but the biggest advantage can only come if the main goal of the institution is educational. Whereas recreational museums do not serve such a grand purpose, only enriching local culture at best and being a run-of-the-mill place to have fun at worst.","## Task Achievement:

2,People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweighs the disadvantages.,"Recently, there is a general preference among  individuals concerning having children at mature times. Although, this will make one to be knowledgeable about two people coming together as one and  be ready to bear any consequences that might arise. But, having the chance of being pregnant and giving delivery without complication is more beneficial. This essay will be explained further in the subsequent paragraphs with examples and a logical conclusion drawn.

Firstly, getting to have offspring in the  later years makes one  have adequate knowledge about the  kids and the process involved thereby getting ready to carter any issue that might arise. For instance, a neighbour of mine once told me that she faced a lot of challenges when she was in the early stage of her pregnancy from her friends and her spouse's friends. She was able to conquer the obstacles because she attended awaiting mother's seminar for 5 months which resulted in her lateness to bear issues. In addition, being mature before one starts giving childbirth will allow the person to be ready to bear any concerns in the long run. 

However, female folks' tendency of getting pregnant in advance period is limited. This is because the hormonal cycle terminates as one is getting older. For instance, my friend that joined her partner 5 years ago is still battling to  miss her period due to an imbalance of hormones which resulted in infertility. Furthermore, giving delivery in old age might lead to  birth complications since the  energy needed for the process of pushing declines as one is ageing. 

To conclude, despite the majority deciding to have babies in their later period so as to have an understanding of raising children and plan to bear the predicaments  in the home,  being able to be with the  child after many years and to be born without dangers are more advantageous.","**Task Achievement:** 7

3,"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own or experience.","Some people believe that we could live in an unpredictable environment that results from global warming, whereas others argue that we should find a way to prevent climate change. I totally agree with the latter statement. In this essay, I will give reasons to support my opinion, including examples from my experience.

Firstly, not only humans but also animals cannot survive in a harsh environment. Therefore, I think finding a way to live with it is wasting our time. In contrast, we should encourage communities to prevent climate change. For example, due to global warming, the weather is getting hotter. Consequently, some people in Africa are suffering from it, and some of them died because they could not bear the weather. Another good example is that one cannot live without animals and plants. If the ecosystem of plants is destroyed, it will affect animals. Unfortunately, humankind will get a negative impact as well.

Secondly, even if protecting the environment requires huge efforts from communities globally, it will lead to a powerful impact and a last longer solution. For instance, dwellers in Australia are confronting with bushfires every year. Australia alone could not prevent this problem, as global warming needs cooperation from everyone. In addition, rising of the weather one degree Celsius may cause some animals extinctions. Nevertheless, societies could stop this issue by paying more attention to adjusting the way of living now, such as eliminating using plastic bags, reducing gas, etc.

In conclusion, people should immediately start to prevent climate change from today, since it will worsen in the future. Besides, I firmly agree that people should stop doing harmful things to nature because this is the only way to live longer.","## Task Achievement:

4,Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"With the economic development, an increasing number of population flooding into big cities to pursue their dreams. A large number of them are suffering from housing scarcity due to the ever-accelerated housing price. Some believe that this problem can be only solved by government interruptions. To my mind, authority plays a role in tackle this problem, while there are still other alternatives that can be applied. 

First, The real estate developers should transform their strategies by building more economically affordable houses rather than the luxurious villa which is out of ordinary community’s financial ability. By doing so, a majority of folk could afford the expenditure on houses with the help of banks or make use of the government policies.  

Another effective way is that people should abandon their traditional thinking believing that a property is the only symbol of success or home. The mass media have the duty to alter the public’s mode of thinking. If people cannot own their property in a short time, renting a house for a short time to raise money for the future house investment could also be a plausible solution. 

Indeed, government can serve as a deterrent in restraining those real estate developers from inflating the house price as their wishes. However, a large proportion of citizens in big cities are still experiencing home scarcity due to the inequity of wealth allocation. The wealthy group or speculators still have access to buy a house prior to those common house buyers. only when house speculations is limited can the ordinary people have an opportunity to pay a house. 

To conclude, I believe that it is superficial to draw a conclusion that the house shortages can be solved rely solely on the government policies. Actually, house developers, government, and the public should made joint effort on this issue.","**Task Achievement:**

5,Environmental damage is a problem in most countries. What factors damage the environment and who should take responsibility?,"In recent years, environmental pollution has become one of the most severe problems that the human race has to face due to the hazardous impacts that this phenomenon can have on people, society as well as the ecosystem. A mass array of elements relating to industrial manufacture and deforestation are believed to be the prominent reasons for the increasing issue of environmental contamination. Therefore, in order to successfully address this predicament, it is necessary for the government, industrial firms and individuals to put in a large amount of effort.

 To commence, one of the predominant factors of pollution is the tremendous amount of industrial waste discharged into the environment by factories. One good illustration of this is the hazardous effects that industrial effluents can have on bodies of water such as lakes, rivers and the ocean. This is due to the fact these aforementioned effluents have not gone through proper treatment, meaning they still remain incredibly toxic, which can result in the contamination of water and the demise of many aquatic lives. In addition, it appears environmental damage can also be attributed to deforestation. To be more specific, the act of removing forests and jungles in order to make room for agriculture and infrastructure can be detrimental to a myriad of fauna and flora species, as a result of their habitats being wiped out. This may lead  to an imbalance in the ecosystem as a whole.

 Therefore, the authority, industrial firms as well as individuals should take appropriate measures in order to tackle this predicament. First of all, the government should promulgate decrees that prohibit contaminated material from being dumped into the environment and encourage manufactories to find an alternative to dispose of their waste, which can greatly alleviate the number of contaminants released. Furthermore, policymakers should enact laws that force manufactories to thoroughly treat their waste before discharging them. While the impacts might be smaller in comparison to the aforementioned remedies, each individual can help to ameliorate the situation by performing simple daily activities, for instance, recycling plastic bottles or planting more trees around neighbourhoods.

 In conclusion, it is evidenced that aspects associated with industrial manufacture and deforestation can be detrimental to the environment. As a consequence, it would be advisable for the authority, corporations as well as citizens to conduct practical measures in order to improve this situation.","## Task Achievement:

6,Films and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It has utterly been claimed that computer games and films which consists of violence are extremely well-known. A plethora of individuals opine that films and computer games have a great number of detrimental impacts on community, so they ought to be restricted; however, an overwhelming majority of people deem that they are innocuous and assist persons to relax.
On the one hand, I understand why a vast majority of people support the opinion that violent movies and games are harmless. The proponents of the notion ensure a variety of points to elaborate their standpoint. First and foremost, in today’s world, people are overloaded with their work, and they also have hectic schedules; therefore, having worked, they are more likely to being interested in crime films and violent games in order to relax and refresh their mind. The second point to note is that according to the researchers of Baku State University, watching criminal films and playing violent games cannot negatively affect individuals since people could hardly remember and repeat these kinds of acts in their real lives.  
Nevertheless, I would side with those who argue that violent films and games should be banned. The primary reason why I think that these types of games and films ought to be forbidden is because they fundamentally consist of violence which can have a huge number of adverse influences on individuals especially immature people. To be more specific, children basically want to repeat and illustrate these actions which they observed, due to this reason that if adolescences watch pornographic films or violent games, they detrimentally affect teenagers’ psychology. Furthermore, these games and films may increase crime rate in the future. In other words, nowadays having observed these movies and games, people may start to practice in their real lives which they noticed, as a result of which in the future individuals tend to commit a crime more than at present.
By way of conclusion, there are certain justifications for the former statement, albeit I am of the opinion that violent movies and computer games should be banned. I recommend that especially immature people should not be interested in these kinds of films and games.","## Task Achievement:

In my view, some of the games such as puzzles can assist them to enhance their skills.

On the one hand, technological advancements have revolutionized people’s lives and youngsters have become the most overdependence users ,particularly in playing computer games. Due to the fact that becoming addicted to digital games might cause several mental and physical health issues. To put it another way, when youth spend abundant of their time playing digital games, they lose touch with friends and  become isolated. Therefore, this situation can lead to anxiety and depression as well as obesity. 

On the other hand, computer games have an essential role in the growth of youth and teach them valuable skills for their future. Problem-solving can be considered the main element that youth can be learned by playing games. To illustrate more, games teach them how to deal with challenges or learn novel techniques to overcome issues. For instance, brain games can be a great opportunity for them to make decisions rapidly and become faster than normal time. Furthermore, according to research which was released by Cambridge University brain games could improve productivity and multitasking. In my view, games can assist them to boost their soft skills.

9,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Young people make the decision to spend more free time doing volunteer community work, instead of playing computer games and watching movies on the smartphone. I deeply agree that this kind of activities can definitely help adolescences collect many skills, knowledges and experiences.

To begin with, teenagers can help local communities do many volunteer activities as they are energetic and willing to learn communication skills and gain valuable experiences. In the nursing home, young people can read books, talk about news and walk with elderly people, assist the disabled people pushing wheelchairs. Therefore, they should give a hand to the others who are living around them.

Additionally, There are many juveniles who prefer spending their leisure time on computers and smartphones without face to face interacting with others. This kind of behavior may impair teenagers’ psychological health, including unsociability and indifference. When they grow up and earn a living, they may not able to adapt society and to fulfill their potentials. In contrast, doing volunteer works for the neighborhood will allow youngsters to confront different people and learning how to get along with them, to encounter different issues and gain knowledges and skills to address them.  As as result, It is a positive benefit for teenagers to do unpaid community works.

In conclusion, Contributing effort for the community brings many advantages to young people, and helps them to establish their goals in the future.","**Task Achievement:**

10,Some people think that the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environmental problems. To what extend to you agree or disagree?,"Automobiles and other vehicles are essential part of transportation for majority of the people residing here in Pakistan. Most people think that the prices of the fuel should be raised by the government to solve the problems,related to the environment, persisting in our country . This essay will discuss that how i disagree, moderately, with the given statement.

First of all uses of the vehicles should be asscessed . Currently according to the statistics, 80% of the population own their own asset be it a car or a bike. The best advantage of owning a vehicle is that it is cheaper than renting a car or looking for some other alternative like taking service from Uber or Careem. So all of such things run on the fuel which in short becomes the basic necessity of every house hold.
Although usage of the fuel does cause damage to the environment but in my opinion the government should look in to the other important factors which are causing bigger problems to our environment. Problems created by the usage of fuel in the cars and other vehicles are very less as compared to the other factors which are contributing to ruin the air.  For example the refErigeators and the aerosol sprays that we use daily emits chloroflourocarbons (CFCs). The relese of this harmful chemical evolves in the air and effects our ozone layer , the layer which protects the planet earth from the damaging ultravoilet radiations ,which is depleting over the passage of time. The prices of such things should be raised because they are causing more damage to the environment.
It is concluded that the prices of the fuel should not be raised for the common means of commute , like cars and motor bikes etc ,as it is, nowadays , necessity for the layman and  instead the government should take appropriate measures to eradicate other problems which are much more harmful to our envoirnment.","**Task Achievement:**

12,"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences.  Only government action can solve this problem.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In today’s era, the problem of housing is seeming to be  rising especially in big cities. There are many people who go to big cities because of their family issues. Also,  the large majority of people and a smaller number of land  results in the problem of housing which will further have many consequences. It is said that, the housing shortage, can be only solved by government action. I agree with this notion. In this essay, I will elaborate on the consequences and also discuss my viewpoint.  

 

Firstly, the government has the powers to control and maintain well all individuals. Government should give some extra facilities to big cities where there are a greater number of people. It’s the responsibility of the government to provide  job opportunities to everyone. So, that people can enjoy their life and has a proper house to build with sufficient money. Secondly, the government should take the land taxes less, so that it becomes easy for a person to maintain their financial levels, which means, a person can buy the land and make their house as they want. For instance, I read in Tribune that 30% of people in Rattan are living below the poverty line and the village is considered to be very big, but there is a problem with the housing shortage. People do not have their homes which will impact  their lives as well as  their children. Those persons seem to be more mentally and physically ill.  

Furthermore, the government should construct a new buildings for those people who cannot afford to buy land or make their big houses. Due to the larger number of people, which give rise to expensive land and that land is not affordable for the common man which leads to a shortage of houses.  

In conclusion, it is clear that government have a major responsibility to tackle this issue. Government should build new buildings and townhouses that can afford people at a genuine price. Through this, people can live stress-free.","**Task Achievement: 6.0**

13,"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to
increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree
with this statement?","One of the most current major environmental problems is the air pollution caused mainly by vehicles exhaust fumes . It is often argued that in order to solve this problem , the government should raise the price of combustibles used by vehicles . In my opinion , I fully disagree with this view and believe that this method can be not an effective solution to this issue and there are other special measures that should be taken  .

On the one hand, the government should afford other convenient alternatives to use automobiles. For example , improving  public transportation and making it more  comfortable and affordable for individuals can be a useful idea  because the capacity of public transport such as trains and buses is enormous  and the number of  used automobiles will decrease significantly and the CO2 emissions will decline also rapidly . In addition , the government should establish public campaigns to aware people of the harmful dangers effects of air pollution on our nature and all of them have to take part of  the responsibility to protect the world by taking simple and healthy  habits such as using  cars only when needed and starting to walk or bike for going to work or study .

On the other hand, the high cost of fuel can discourage some persons especially those who are not rich in driving . However, the main issue is that some people have unhealthy attitudes toward the environment . For instance ,those  wealthy individuals would , most likely , still drive cars , even if the price of fuels become expensive . Moreover , individuals who work far away from their home ,  would obligatory drive cars . Therefore , despite the rise of fuels , the population still use them for their vehicles.

In conclusion, rising prices of combustibles do not seem to be an effective solution. Although it would alleviate the problem  in some cases , it would not suffice to solve it definitively . That is why governments should consider public awareness campaigns that would help the population to understand  the danger of an unhealthy environment and should make alternatives affordable and convenient .","## Task Achievement:

14,Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"E-learning is considered one of the most significant features for the contemporary technology. While some opponents are of the view that  attending face to face courses in universities campus pose more privileges, others argue that in today’s fast pace lifestyle, offering online courses holds  spectacular positivities. I am compatible with the believe that the remote studies provide with exceptional benefits.

 

At the outskirts, the far distance factor, depicts the positive image of the e-learning. In the past , it was implausible for students to enrol  in courses offered by  prestigious universities, due to the considerable distances between countries. Today, students can readily search online and select the best education systems, mentors or professors . Consequently, students can attend and enhance their education level.

Thus, online courses are rendering increasingly in altitude the proportion of high education levels for students around the world, neglecting the distance factor.

Furthermore, another positive factor, is the timing dilemma. When the universities offer remote classes,  this will abundant spare time. If the apprentice attends the campus lectures, wastes time in the transportation and the road,and this  may be more than the lecture period. In the contrary, the remote lectures save  spare time, whereas students can exploit this time in studies or even other activities. For instance,  some employees, because of their work timing, they cannot enhance their education level. However, with the advent of online courses, the breadwinner has become simplicitly registering  for university courses. In addition,  While daily commuting considers exhausting for student’s efforts, the presence of online courses serves as a harness for individuals’ energy. That is why offering online courses from universities holds a variety of positivities.

15,"In many countries, governments spend large sums of money on the arts and this is supported by some taxpayers as worthwhile. Others, however, think that this money would be better spent on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In many nations, governments spend a lot of budget on the arts and many people think that this money would be great to spend on health and education because this budget came from taxes from the population in their country. This essay will argue about paying a lot of money to arts and also on health and education. In my opinion, I totally believe that paying a big budget for health such as buying new medical technology for hospitals and paying a lot of money for schools to develop  education is better than spending money on the arts.

First, I will write about the benefits of schools. For schools, it is very important to many countries to have good schools for their people because there need to have an educated and government can develop their humans with a good education so, they need to buy new technology and a good book.

16,"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after graduating from high school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is thought that pursuing higher education leads to a successful career ladder, while others believe that getting a job right after high school would be better. This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding that I am in favor of the latter notion.

On one hand, it is true that studying at a higher educational institution is one of the best ways to succeed. Firstly, university graduates tend to receive decent salaries. This is because they have equipped themselves with basic knowledge related to their career, which helps them to easily tackle unexpected problems and increase work productivity. Secondly, job seekers with a degree have higher chances to be selected into companies. For instance, several firms who have powerful impacts in Vietnam’s business tend to hire bachelor degree holders since they are trained in an academic environment for a quality time.

On the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that seeking for an occupation after graduating is also advantageous. The first reason is people will become more mature and independent. Having a well-earned job gives youngsters opportunities to become financially stable, this means that they can invest in themselves and help their family. Another reason is that they can be promoted easier. While others are studying, the ones who enter the workforce right after highschool are experiencing work realistically, they gain more experience and get more chances of promotions. 

In conclusion, while it is irrefutable that higher education is the best way to be successful, I would contend that getting a job right after high school would be beneficial.","## Task Achievement:

17,"Interviews form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some poeple think that interviews is not a reliable mthod of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that the best method to recruit employees for the job is arranging interviewing sessions which are usually preferred by most large-scale companies, whereas the rest of the people have a strong faith in other ways of selecting workers. Although  the interview is an appropriate mode which allows one to check the individual's qualification level as well as background,  I believe that the other criteria are also significant for checking how much practical knowledge and skill is acquired by the recruiter.

To begin with, the first point viewpoint which is taking interviews can assist hiring managers to know the basic details about the person. This is because in the interviews manager has an opportunity to ask any questions regarding past experiences, certain backgrounds, qualifications and difficult questions relating to the certain field in which the employee wants to work in. For instance, the biggest Tata Steel company in the U.S. revealed that they are choosing the best employers from 10 out of 1 who do not lacks in any single question from the total questionnaire session. However, according to, my perspective interviews are not enough the other factors and capabilities required to run the business cannot be ignored.

Apart from this,  education is necessary but other practical knowledge is a must which can be checked by arranging demo sessions where the performance of the representative should be analysed. This is because the most essential abilities needed in an operator are leadership, coordination for teamwork, communication skills and independency which make a person an adequate employee and can be only experienced by the manager when analysing their trial during demo recruitment sessions. For example,  as per the news headlines in Argentina, the labourer's work is customised first before selecting the final workers. That is why if the person will already check it gives relief to the manager and no regret in future.

19,"As major cities in the world are growing today, so do their problems. What are problems for young people who are living in the cities as the result of continued growth? What are solutions for these problems?","As large cities in many parts of the world are increasingly developing these days, there are a lot of issues for the young generation who are urban citizens. Several problems result from this phenomenon and some solutions should be tackled by the government and individuals to improve the situation.

The growing population in the large city has brought two main problems. To begin with, many young people have difficulty getting employed due to the competitive job market. This is because rural people tend to migrate to urban areas for better job opportunities, leading to a large number of young job seekers struggling to find employment. Another issue worth mentioning is the high cost of living has put heavy pressure on young people to secure living expenses. A considerable rise in exorbitant prices of commodities has placed people who have a job with low compensation at a disadvantage, which lowers their living conditions.Taking HCM city as an example, The fresh graduates often struggles to maintain a good and stable job and quality of their living.

20,"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been discussion revolving around the issue of whether museums are a place where people get educated or it is an amusing place to get entertained.  I tend to believe that exhibition center should be a place of education. In this essay I will explain my opinion.

The primary factor we need to take into consideration is that museums are tourist’s biggest attraction place. For example, people who come to visit any country tend to stop by the museums to be entertained. It is that because places like this manage to put exhibitions that are interesting or somehow be appealing to the customers. Moreover, it is a perfect place to entertain children. For example, it sparks children curiosity and get them to be excited for school. It is for the reason that museums are predisposed to have exhibitions that keep children interested.

In contrast, some others may claim that museums goal is to educate. To start with, children or adults who are going to museums learn about different cultures, historical events and it can develop the  perfect mindset for young people which help to sympathize or identify with other people. Another argument can be made that it allows people to find their interests in life through authentic demonstrations that are held in museums.

21,"Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people opine that the historical artefacts should be returned to the country of origin which were captured during wars or colonialization while others argue that it should remain where it is right now.  I agree with the former view and this essay will discuss the reasons in brief.

Firstly, many people have sentiments and emotions attached to the objects which were taken away from their country in the past. Besides, this also exhibits the nation history and cultural values. For example, during the British rule in India, the idol of Lord Vishnu was stolen from the temple and is now being displayed in a museum of London. Many people believe that the ideal place of the statue should be the temple from where it was stolen rather than a museum. Due to this many Indian citizens are putting pressure on the government to bring those items back.

Secondly, these items can be used as a remedy for building and improving the relationship between the two countries. Also, it helps to bring peace and harmony between them. For example, when the ties between France and Egypt were not at their best, Prime minister of France decided to return mummies which were captured during World War I to Egypt in order to normalise their relationship. Due to this gesture of goodwill, bilateral talks resumed between these two sovereign states after a decade.  

To conclude, bringing back the historical artefacts not only boost the relationship between states but also brings happiness in the society as many sentiments and culture values are attached to it.","**Task Achievement:**

22,Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Not being able to focus on class is one of the main concerns in the early-age learning journey. From educational perspectives, there are two main reasons which are the mismatched learning styles, and long-term exposure to poor nutrition and lack of sleep. 

Firstly, it is irrefutable that we all learn differently, and so do children. Some learn best by seeing, hearing or doing. Therefore, if the teachers only emphasize a specific learning style and apply it to all the children, this can result in a lack of focus and understanding. In this case, the solution is to ask the teachers to observe what are the options that they can choose to engage children in their learning experiences. For example, inquiry-based learning projects can be planned and adapted to search for the right methods. 

Secondly, it is sad to state, but, indeed, children cannot focus on their studies simply because they do not get enough sleep or nutrition. In fact, there are circumstances where many children do not have enough recommended sleeping hours or have to skip breakfast to be on time. Consequently, these children do not have energy and become distracted in class. As adults, we need to take our steps to reduce the numbers of children who have physical disadvantages. Government, schools and families have to work together to build up better schedules so children can have more time to sleep. Besides, they also must have free-food programs for poor children to make sure they are full when they study. 

In conclusion, there are many reasons which could lead to the failure of paying attention in the classroom. However, from my perspective, mismatched learning styles and lack of nutrition and sleep are the main causes. Together with families, governments and schools have to work on their policies in teaching methods and free-food programs to support children more.","## Task Achievement:

23,Some countries have an ever-increasing proportion of population who are aged 15 and younger. What is your opinion of the current and future effects it may have in those countries ?,"In some countries, the number of young people who are under 15 years old has a significant rise in recent years. In my opinion, this trend would influence the current and future times of these countries both in negative and positive ways.

Having more young people would bring various impacts on society such as allocation of educational resources and job opportunities. Firstly, if public schools have full enrollment, parents would have to send their children to private schools. This means parents need to pay higher tuition fees than the cost of going to public schools. It could largely increase the economic burdens for children’s families. Secondly, in the coming decades, it might be more challenging for these young people to secure jobs, especially when governments have trouble in offering sufficient job positions.

Meanwhile, a larger population of youth may also bring advantages to the nations. On the one hand, in order to ease the current pressure, governments need to invest more money in infrastructure, including public transportation, sports facilities, and school construction. This could create a better environment for teenagers. On the other hand, the younger generation tends to be energetic and creative, which is a useful source of innovation and evolution for their own countries. Therefore, a nation would be more advanced in the upcoming years by having more youngsters.

24,The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, children’s participation in sports at school is widely advocated and encouraged, as it is considered the most effective way for children to learn cooperation at an early age. However, I would argue that the value of sports activity in terms of facilitating collaboration is overestimated, and the adverse outcome may well appear.

It is recognized that children are naturally inclined to compete, and games are usually made to include a competitive factor. Sports, obviously and unfortunately, are competitive by nature: only one win and the rest lose. It adds to children’s stress by pressuring them to be outstanding within the team and win over the other side and undermines the accessibility of cooperative thoughts and behaviours. Especially in the current social context, winning has been widely accepted and allowed to become a prominent part of the mainstream. As is often the case in sports, parents or coaches or even the audience on the sidelines cannot help shouting to urge children to win and compete rather than cooperate.

Therefore, simply counting on sports to cultivate a sense of cooperation and collaboration seems to be far from satisfactory. Instead, more attention needs to be drawn to create an environment that inspires collaboration and a joyful experience. Children learn character mainly through imitation. They listen, observe and learn skills by watching the words and behaviours of parents, teachers and peers. Family and school projects could be devised to include everyone and make everyone feel needed. Parents and teachers could guide the children to recognize that everyone has something valuable to offer in a group, and show appreciation for their contributions. By deliberately practicing these skills and recreating such an atmosphere, we manage to teach children behaviours that will ultimately benefit themselves.

In conclusion, sports activities can be a platform for a negative type of competitiveness and sometimes exacerbate it. It is more effective to turn every day into boundless opportunities to emphasize the importance of cooperation and fuel children to exercise and practice the art of cooperation.","**Task Achievement: [6]**

25,Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Technology is progressing day by day that strives hard to make human lives comfortable. It is argued by many public that world well-being issues should be addressed by engineering sciences, whilst it is thought by others that there are a lot more crucial jobs to talk about. In this essay, I will highlight both sides of the arguments along with illustrations and at the end put a conclusion.

To begin with, It is thought by some masses that robotics should concentrate on world dwellers' wellness because people's longevity has fallen down. Since the planet is facing new diseases which are sometimes incurred due to improper medications or zero availability of medical equipment. Additionally, lack of research in a related field sometimes leads to no clue for health sectors to identify the illness at an early stage. Thus, it is found very common at current that minor health issues cause death. To cite an example, If there was a thorough study on viruses infection, the planet would never see a pandemic like this, As it has been experiencing since 2020.

Furthermore, It is considered by a group of people that the mechanics should focus on other important difficulties such as environmental degradations , Cheap transportation sources etc. Inasmuch, At the moment earth is facing worse climate conditions and the environmentalist is claiming; In fact,  it will be the worst in near future if not tackle down. Similarly, people are still using conventional transportation means which take hours and days to reach the destinations because the plane journey in terms of fare is too expensive. earth's average temperature is soaring by 2 degrees Celcius which is  alarming and if by 2050,  it will not let down then there will be a dominant warmer season and less rain that lead to scarcity of food, For example.

To conclude, Many people are saying that science focal point should be health issues, This is because people's lives span are decreased while others think the contrary, they are claiming that there are other problems on the table which should be picked, like nature abasement, low price transits and so on. However, I personally feel that  science should keep a balance between them and pay  even attention to both sides and the authority needs to  allocate equal funds.","**Task Achievement: 5**

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","In the realm of  children improvement,some people believe that guardians have the main effect on them,whereas the opponents have alleged that Tv and their friends are more powerful to influence them.However,in my point of view,they both are indispensable in forming the personality of the learners.mentioned sides are uttered here.

  One of the most highlighted discrepancies between parents and others has to do with their positions in the mind of their offspring,while they are usually looked up to as the heroes of their next generation,Therefore,they are pursued by toddlers as roleodes.For instance,based on the surveys that have taken place in this area,the majority of juveniles are similar to their parents in various sectors,such as either their character or even the same capabilities to encountering the issues.Furthermore,the bold roles of the elderly emerge in the situations that the young requires to be conducted via consultation or more harsh reactions.As a vivid case,the older not only are aware of the threats for the juveniles owing to the experiences that they used to have but also they have a better prospect of the conditions that appear while they are monitoring the activity of their adolescents,which can be exploited to control them in hazardous circumstances.In other words,they can assist their heir to opt for appropriate programs or even friends.

  On the other hand,owing to the close understanding that individuals have if they are in the same age,it is clear that babies are attracted to people in their age,hence they will learn a lot of things from them by mimicking their function,which has been released by the experts.For example,in the conditions that there are divergent toys,most of the unadult folks are absorbed in the ones that their patrons are using  and even if they change their mind regarding the utilisation of objects again the followers would strive to get the new one.Moreover,the broadcasted cartoons from Tv have the potential to penetrate their audiences as an offspring of the professional mindsets that have been exploited to build that.Namely,using scion to play opted roles in movies or even looking at the globe from the prospect that their followers can perceive,which stimulate the youngster to trust in and accept the issues that have been transmitted to them.

To recapitulate,although some individuals have claimed that friends and Tv have a stronger impression on  children due to the appealing energy that they have,the rest mentioned their guardians as the main manager,who can control the activity of their offspring.Anyway,to me they both have their share in the life of the young,so,a mixture of them should be considered to guide the juvenile toward the appropriate goals.","## Task Achievement:

27,; Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The past 50 years have seen a dramatic increase in the occurrence of environmental problems. Some individuals claim that this issue could be solved by raising the cost of fuel. While I partly agree with this statement, I do believe that there are many other ways to deal with this issue, instead of looking at only one aspect of the problem.

To begin with, it is an indisputable fact that after the industrial revolution, the number of car factories  increased. As a result, nowadays, the air is adversely affected by  car exhaust gases which cause a harsh climate. To explain, these gases contain a huge amount of toxic substances, chief among them is Co2. To illustrate, Tehran- the capital of Iran- is a salient example of a polluted city. I suggest that by raising the pay for gasoline and petroleum, presumably, people tend to use less their private cars. Nonetheless, reaching this aim needs pivotal infrasturactions like a good public transportation system as well as implementation such cultivation as car/bike-sharing schemes.

Equally importantly, the Earth suffer from some other problems more than just weather issues. Firstly, in recent days, more and more pollutants are discharged into the oceans. Thus, the lives of marine animals have become under threat of extinction. A salient instant is mass-stranding  in whales. Secondly, another major contributing factor is nature challenges. To explain, it might have been seen that more woodlands are recently destroyed by builders to build more houses and villas.

By way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that whereas increasing the expense of fuel can be beneficial for the sake of air pollution,  there are a number of other problems which are pivotal as much as air contamination.","**Task Achievement:**

28,Leaders and directors in organizations are normally older people. Some people think having a younger leader would be better. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Society experiences a trend that the old in many organizations normally take over the leading and directing positions. Whereas, there is an opposite opinion to prefer to have a leader who is young. I totally agree with the idea that the people who lead and direct any organization should be the older generation.

On the one hand, working with a person that becomes the header of a company at an early age would have many merits. First, they might put less pressure on the industries’ members. This is because they are not as strict as the older so it could create a more comfortable atmosphere to work. Second, these teenagers are more likely to be open-minded so it is rather easy to collaborate. Moreover, whenever receiving either positive or negative comments, they are always willing to accumulate them and adjust properly to have a more well-rounded perspective of working. 

On the other hand, though there are plenty of benefits brought by the younger headers, it is unacceptable to underestimate the abilities of mature leaders as well as directors. All of them (Time’s up) have a certain wealth of experiences after overcoming a wide range of challenges, which helps them to acquire the flexibility in tackling tough problems. In addition, they work with their high responsibilities and well-manner personalities, especially in Japan. For instance, Japanese industries’ CEOs pay much attention to the honesty of workers and penalize those who avoid their own work.

In conclusion, despite the fact that it is quite good to have a young person  run a company, I still believe that the better controller should be the older people. This trend is easy to understand due to the experiences and the personal traits of the old outweigh the less pressure and opened-mindedness of the younger CEOs.","### Task Achievement:

30,"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","In some nations, there are many people attracted to find out about the history of the building where they live. I really agree with this argument because this trend leads to positive impacts for homeowners to know about the capacity and safety of the house from professional analysis.

Learning about designed buildings plays a vital role in configuring the space area and preventing accidents in extreme conditions. Firstly, the strength of the building should be known by the home’s owner to adjust the function of rooms inside the building. It would be a danger, especially for buildings with a second floor or more if the building retains a load over the allowed capacity from the load of furniture, people, and household appliances. Then, it will end with structural failure. In addition, researching on building’s history can be a part of safety management because the owners gain experience with the building’s capacity under natural disasters such as heavy storms, or earthquakes.

On the other hand, the rule of building information can be tracked at the initial plan before it was built. Because of the limitation of knowledge about building design, the history of the building can be assessed by hiring a consultant engineer or contacting the developer, considered professional. As a result, the specialist will decide if the building conditions are still safe and serviceable or not. If it is not confirmed in good condition, the consultant can give some recommendations to maintain the building to be considered a good operation.

32,"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.","There are various different opinions on studying after high school. While some people see that it is an

excellent alternative to getting an ideal job, it is an excellent alternative to getting an ideal job. There is a big gap between the college and business so I personally believe that students need to work after school due to multiple reasons.

To begin with, On the one hand, it could be understood that some are aware of the difficulty of promotion

 for workers without bachelor's degrees because certificates are initially required by recruiters. Accordingly, some people could see that being on university graduate would be the safe way to get an ideal job, as evident on the labor market in 2021 in some Asian countries. There was around 30% of graduated students had their salary expectation after two years of work experience. Moreover, this activity significantly provides more of their major's knowledge which would be helpful in offices. In Vietnam, fortunately, over 38% of graduated learners work on their right business degrees.

Although on the other hand, business experience after high school would help people save time and reduce their personal economic burden. In many nations, college fees could be probably an installment debt for the rest of their life. It might be a serious problem in some risky

situations such as the Covid – 19 pandemic, recessions, so on (you should not write like this ... you can write ""so on"" unless they have enough time to work and save in order to own their funds. Besides, they start to contributing to their career based on their

 experiences, and the more experienced workers get,the higher position required. For example, instead of graduating, people could start to observe and learn from colleagues in the business market and then continue myriad projects during the first 2 years, followed by contributing their own projects and promote to a higher position in the next 2 years.

33,Some people believe that all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent machines. What is your opinion?,"many people claim that all job desks will be replaced by this artificial intelligence program. my own view on the matter is the situation depends on the job itself.

To begin with, it is true that nowadays many companies compete to make the smartest artificial intelligence in order to be well-known for the project they made. moreover, not all works are able to be done by machines. for example, for people who work for human health, this job apparently needs a real person to check their conditions. thus, until this present time, Doctor parts cannot be taken away and done by artificial intelligence. Although one part of the medical world is being seen as having huge potential for helping doctors to make diagnoses.

on the other hand, artificial intelligence is suited for automatic routine, formulaic which does not require creative thinking or human intuition. restaurant waitress could be a good idea example here. In addition in recent years, a lot of restaurants have used robots to deliver meals to the customers which this part would be an efficient way to serve the buyers. in contrast, chefs in restaurants have to not be replaced due to the skills they have to make the orders.

To draw the conclusion, artificial intelligence is great to have a work like humans do. even though, there are still exist the work which has to be done by human intuition. likewise, artificial intelligence and human collaboration could evolve into partnerships where artificial intelligence handles data processing and humans focus on strategy and service. to my way of thinking, the existence of artificial intelligence yet creates a wide range of new jobs.","## Task Achievement:

34,Some people think that robots are important for human future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is ubiquitously seen these days that the use of robots has been intensified more than ever, given various emerging dynamics. For human future growth, some individuals believe that the use of robots is important. Contrastingly, others believe that robots have a negative impact on the society. However, I find myself standing tall with the latter viewpoint. In the section underneath, this piece of writing shall propagate both the merits and demerits of the use of robots in human lives and society.

Some people believe the use of robots has many downsides for human growth. 

First and foremost, with the increasing use of AI, almost in every field, the work which used to be performed by humans has been overtaken by robots and resulted in a loss of jobs and unemployment. Secondly, a lot of individuals are using it to perform fraud. Nevertheless, over-reliance on robots could suffocate human creativity and critical thinking, as people may become too dependent on AI to solve problems. Recently, a renowned newspaper published a news, with the use of an AI-drive robot, a person was able to hack bank account details to steal money. 

There are advantages to the use of robots. With the use of AI, productivity, and efficiency have increased and human error has exponentially decreased. Furthermore, AI-powered robots can analyze vast amounts of data and make complex decisions For example, the Tesla self-driving car uses vehicle sensors to mimic the human brain resulting in a decrease in accidents and is programmed to ensure human safety. Additionally, in the healthcare sector, robots can perform surgeries with reduced human error.

35,"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality , high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticisms on their teachers. Others think this will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.","Nowadays, most individuals claim that high school grades should be promoted to say their suggestions and criticisms in order to boost the quality of education in the country. Whereas, others believe that this case will result in destroying the balance between students and educators. However, in my opinion, schoolers should be allowed to offer their own ideas about their teachers' knowledge and ability. In the following paragraphs, I shall discuss both views and explain why it is a must thing. 

           On the one hand, schoolers at high schools are not wise ample to attack the lack of educators. As cadre study at the university and attain diploma and so they have enough knowledge to teach recruitment. But, high school grades are in adolescence and so their negative feedback is based on emotional feelings rather than details. Moreover, this phenomenon leads to loss of honour and routine. As a result, the quality of education decrease. Additionally, the dominance may move from mature personnel to silly pupils. 

           On the other hand, enlistment' criticisms will help the team to rework. In this way, educators can recognise their topical strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, positive critical remarks assist  tutors to polish their lessons taking into account the enjoyment and recommendation of their pupils. In consequence, this helps to improve schoolers' interests toward gaining knowledge. Also, the bond becomes strong between the team and enlistment. Students can guide personnel toward providing educational experiences they truly enjoy.

36,"Nowadays, celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Today, celebrities are more popular for their financial state and stylish lifestyle than for their professional awards and achievements. Such a tendency negatively affects young people. I absolutely agree with this as the excessive demonstration of wealth and focusing only on materialistic things can raise selfish generations without values and principles.

First of all, boasting being a wrong pattern of behaviour is continuously shown by the media misleading many fans of young age around the world. Thus, youngsters start to think that such behaviour is a direct way to success and popularity among peers. Not only is it dangerous but also it sets the wrong mindset that hard work and high achievements in any sphere are not necessary. For instance, some popular bloggers from the internet claim that it is easy to become successful and financially independent without any efforts. A lot of teenagers are not aware of the fact that every famous blogger has a big team responsible for the content and marketing.

Furthermore, it is quite controversial that materialistic values are the most important ones and everyone should strive for them. Besides, spiritual development is as important as physical and materialistic ones. Without solid values and principles, people are likely to be disoriented in this fast-moving world as one trend can be easily substituted by another. In other words, the idea that money and popularity are tightly connected is detrimental, especially for young unformed minds. A prime example would be young singers. Some of them are known to be scandalous, while others take drugs because wealth and glamour changed their perception in a negative way.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that seeking wealth and glamour rather than high results is detrimental to young generations. I would recommend ignoring a wealthy lifestyle actively advertised by the media.","**Task Achievement:**

Within the scope of this writing, some causes are discussed and from then the ways to look for information are mentioned.

As the beginning part of the discussion, the reasons are worth mentioning initially. Firstly, we can see that nowadays, culture plays an important role in human lives. It means, the more societies develop, the more people tend to appreciate ancient values. To illustrate, some old villas that were built in Da Lat city of Vietnam in the Indochina period were bought with a lot of money, even they are more expensive than modern houses. Secondly, finding out about the history of the house or building helps people learn about design styles. Through this result, more and more people want to show their knowledge to other people.

In detail, directions and constructions of rooms, as well as the history of a house,history of a residence can affect to owner’s life.

Researching the history of the house or building, in some cases, is not simple. However, there are some steps for people to do. One recommendation is that they can chat with the previous owners of the building or receive advice from neighbours. Furthermore, there are forums or social groups on the Internet for people to get information about real estate. Thus, it is logical that we can share the story and discuss it in forums to collect more knowledge. In addition , a look further into this problem is that people can look for instruction from books, newspapers or experts.

38,"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to

do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community.

They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager

and society as a whole.

Do you agree or disagree?","Many people consider that all adolescents should contribute their spare time volunteering the local community tasks. Which could be beneficial for both the nation and the individual. I am strongly in the favour of these believers. This essay will highlight a few of the advantages in the following paragraphs.

To begin with, the most predominant benefit of this trend is that the teenager could broaden their minds in the field. In other words, they can have good knowledge of the fieldwork in their school tenure which can be helpful for them to dive into the work easily. For instance, if youngster invests their free time to assist society's tasks, it can increase their wisdom which could be helpful in their job searching. On the other hand, Society can have an advantage from teenagers' unpaid services in many aspects such as cleaning the city's debris or working in a public library. Thus, volunteering could have multifarious benefits for both. 

To strengthen the view of advantage is that youngster can increase their communication skills and good life experience by interacting with elderly people. To explain it, teenagers can do unpaid service in old aged homes which could be a blessing for them and help to avoid elder loneliness. For example, By doing this, will not only increase their communication skill, but also they can obtain their whole life's experience. Therefore, society can make a strong bond between youngsters.

39,"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the eyes of some, businesses are not only economic units generating wealth; rather, they should shoulder social responsibilities. I agree with this opinion as when doing so, businesses are indeed investing in their sustainable development.

In the short term, shouldering social responsibilities, say social and environmental ones, could buy businesses opportunities to gain profit in turn. When fulfilling their tax obligations, businesses can improve their financial credit scores. This is because businesses can prove that their tax records are clean, thereby buying them opportunities to approach low-interest loans and raise funds more effectively. Thus, businesses can take this advantage of competitiveness over their rivals and gain more profits. Also adopting manufacturing practices that minimize environmental damage is financially beneficial for businesses. Accordingly, this strategy enables businesses to avoid huge environmental taxes and protects businesses from boycotting campaigns of environmental activists.

In the long term, This strategy could bring businesses both sustainable profits and new customers. Taking social responsibility, say philanthropic activities, means an investment in expanding the future's market. An explanation for this argument is when helping impoverished people escape ingrained poverty and have a higher standard of living, businesses are creating potential customers in the future, and in turn, selling more products to these new generations of customers. Furthermore, this strategy helps businesses draw new customers. In fact, when taking responsibility, businesses could establish a picture of themselves as economic units not only generating wealth but also willing to accompany society in reaching common goals and solving challenges. This helps build trust and bonds between businesses and the community, and new customers will come later. 

In conclusion, although businesses are economic units generating wealth, They should shoulder social responsibilities because this is a sapient investment in their sustainable development.","**Task Achievement:**

Thus, reducing environment pollution should be the first priority of the government.

I strongly support view that of the public because that practice will not only help teens by making satisfy and chance to explore skills but also provides helping hands to association people.

Being a part of social worker, gives  satisfaction to engaged youngsters. In their busy life they don’t have time for extra curriculum activities which make them more depressed, but working on community task give a chance to them to divert their energy in a good way which helps to reduce their depression. For example :- a study carried out by a university in the United States in which get results that adolescents who work for 10 hours are less likely to feel depressed as compared to those who do not work  volunteer.

42,"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.
To what extent do you agree or disagree.","Nowadays, many volunteering activities spread over the internet, searching for participants. This activity has a lot of benefits for the participants and of course,  the neighbourhood. It might be the reason why some people think that is mandatory for adolescents to take part in  volunteering activity. In my view, I agree with that statement. So, in this essay, I will explain the reasons why I support that. 

The first reason is for  teenagers. The young generation can increase more social experience. This includes how to understand the problem, how to gain the idea to solve that issue, and how to take the actions. For example, there is a charity event that is conducted by the local church. The aim is to get money for people in East Indonesia, which suffered from an earthquake. Joining this program will increase our conscience about other people, and furthermore, it gives us a chance to take  humanitarian action. In addition, this experience can not be learned at school or by attending an academic course. 

Secondly, it is for the neighbourhood. First of all, many communities have their own problems  and many of which do not know what to do. Regarding that matter, many helpless people need some help because our government can not reach this issue. For instance,  there is a person, who has lived alone for more than 50 years in a hut. He also suffers from cancer since 10 years ago, and of course, he does not have money because he has lived under  poverty. Thence, you can see that this person really needs help. So, a particular organization, such as Tzu Chi, will get the doctor for this man and also renovate his hut. Finally, for over than 9 years, he can feel a decent life like other people. 

In conclusion, unpaid community service can be a platform for adolescents to expand their soft skill in humanity area. On the other hand, many helpless people also have the opportunity to feel happy.  Hence, in the end, I will totally agree with the idea of having  unpaid work as a compulsory matter for the adolescents, concerns  the benefits of it.","## Task Achievement:

The major cause is probably the satisfaction of people’s general curiosity, especially about the origin of their house or building, because for roughly two-thirds of the day they stay at home, so it is understandable if they want to know deeply about it. For example, they may want to know when it was constructed, who the former owners were, or what kind of materials were used for contracting. Furthermore, all this information may assist them in preparing a renovation plan for the future, such as which part of the house or building they should examine or the cost of the remodelling. That can make them feel more secure about their accommodation's condition. Finally, knowing about the history of their house or building may make them feel more appreciative of what they have, and in another situation, if they want to sell it, they can pass the information to the next owner because the purchaser might want to know. 

 

 

Turning to the ways to research information, first from the former owner or the landlord. For instance, if they just rent the accommodation, they can ask directly from the landlord. If they brought this place, they should get in touch with the person who was the former owner if they can get the address of her or his. The second way is by going to the local cadastral office. In this place, there will be employees working there to support the information fully. 

 

To summarize, the cause of this trend is primarily related to curiosity and the repair plan, and there are two ways to aid them: the landlord, the former owner, or the local cadastral office.","### Task Achievement:

44,The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Other think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The innovation of the technology has been the highly debated topic since a decade. Some believe that numerous option among the electronic devices has raised the difference in between impoverished and wealthy civilian. Whereas, the rest of the folks argue that it has decreased the difference. Firstly, this essay will discuss the reason behind the thought of increasing the diversity and reason behind declining the same. Lastly, state the opinion in the favour of making equal status among the civilian.

On the one hand, the main reason behind the social status is the capacity to buy a latest electronic device. The wealthy folks have more money and tend to be eager to show off their strong financial status to the world. As a result, there is a clear line formed in between the impoverished and wealthy people as wealthy folks have the branded gadgets. For example, according to the apple company of the USA report, 70% buyer of the apple appliances  belonged to the wealthy family as they can able to buy those expensive appliances. 
On the other hand,  except for the renowned companies, many other offers the same device at a reasonable price. Consequently, all classes of people are able to buy those gadgets. Because, those gadgets are in the excellent design and fundamental functions to use it. Thus, no one can distinguish the difference between the people who have the same device. For instance, as per the user data of the mobile phone offices,  there are almost 95% of the people have the electronic device due to the availability of more options in it.  
From my point of view, I believed, nowadays, just having a appliances, no one can identify whether the other person is from a wealthy family or poor. Due to having branded a phone with the impoverished people as well. 
In conclusion, having a latest device does not mean that the person is wealthy as now everyone has the range of new technology at their home. However, to identify the difference between poor and rich person, the best is the bank statement and their living style.","## Task Achievement:

45,"The expansion of multinational companies and increase in globalization produces positive
effects to everyone. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement","Globalization and the flourishing of multinational enterprises is a ubiquitous phenomenon that is benefitting not just the nations but also inhabitants. Both these factors have completely flipped the image of society and its working bringing out positives as well as negatives. Nevertheless, I strongly concur with the idea that it showcases the positive developments. I will elucidate on my conviction with relevant examples.

To commence with, I believe that international migrations have significantly influenced the Education sector. Students are moving into other lands to fulfil their objectives and passions. For example, numerous pupils dream about pursuing degrees in the best universities of the world which is made easier due to globalization. Moreover, after ,studies they can opt to work in the second nation as indigenous corporations welcome overseas talents. Even the world has become a global village where everyone is living with integrity. Hence, such movements are glorifying the countries as well as scholars by giving limitless opportunities.

Furthermore, viewing the economic aspects of nations, I opine that tourism and the aviation industries are progressing boundlessly through which profits are generated and could be utilized in the uplift of the citizens. In the light of globalization, corporates can work globally by working on smooth norms helping other lands to alleviate unemployment rates. For instance, Google is operating in almost every part of the world linking discrete employees. Moving ahead, the social facet is inescapable. When people move  abroad, they meet up and become friends with locals which aids them to know and accept their culture. Therefore, multicultural societies are taking birth welcoming every religion and culture.

In conclusion, undoubtedly worldwide movements outshine and assisting the workforce to travel around the world to take every possible chance. I reckon that worldwide firms in connection with globalization have made the world a better place for everyone.","## Task Achievement:

47,"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is true, that art is depicted as one of the most crucial directions in the Humanities section. However, some sceptics insist on how meaningless this subject might be for children. Personally, I would support the idea of merging the disciplines into an upscale program for talented individuals. In the other words, my opinion is based on finding the balance between these groups.

On the one hand, not every child is keen on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) subjects. For example, according to the worldwide statistics, 60% of primary school students, mostly enjoy moulding the clay figures and draw, as long as it brings the flow of relaxation. It is widely known, that working with scientific papers and other practical materials requires a high level of stress and anxiety, while the art-related subjects help the pupils expressing their emotions and feelings to the fullest. Moreover, the whole process is operated by the sense of creativity, which is a must-have job qualification nowadays. 

On the other hand, the parental concerns are welcomed to be acceptable, too. Although, the idea of releasing innovative potential may sound promising, the most desirable specialists in 2020 are the software and civil engineers. Having said that, the vast majority of adults are worried about the future perspectives of their children. Unluckily, hard work of, for instance,  graphic designers and book illustrators, is not being paid off well enough. Furthermore, a lot of artistic professions are not taken seriously and considered as not the best value for money, especially, for those parents, whose children are attending private schools.

In conclusion, both scientific and art directions should be highlighted as significant in 2020. I strongly believe, that despite their advantages and disadvantages, they can easily complement each other. In this case, the visual representation of objects can be a great inspiration for the future inventions.","### Task Achievement:

48,"Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","offspring are the backbone of every country. So, there are communities who tend to believe that youngsters should be encouraged to initiate social work as it will result in flourished society and individualistic growth of youngsters themselves. I, too believe that this motivation has more benefits than its drawbacks.

To begin with,  social work by children can be easily associated with personality development because, during this drive, they tend to communicate with a variety of people, which leads to polished verbal skills. For example, if they start convincing rural people to send their children to school they have to be such a convincing attitude along with developed verbal skills to deal with diverse kinds of people there. This improved skill will help them lifelong in every arena. Apart from this, the true values of life like tolerance, patience, team spirit, cooperation can be learned. Besides that, the young minds serve the country with full enthusiasm that gives the feeling of fulfilment and self-satisfaction. This worthiness for themselves brims them with self-confidence and patriotic feeling. Moreover, going and experiencing multiple cultures and traditions make their horizon so broad that add one more feather to their cap.

However, It is truly said, no rose without thrones. Can the drawbacks of this initiation be ignored? Children go to school, participate in different curriculum activities, endure the pressure of peers, parents, and teachers and in the competitive world, they should not be expected to serve society without their self-benefits. This kind of pressure might bring resentment to their mind.

By leveraging social media, we can share information and build relationships with friends, family, colleagues and even celebrities. It creates a sense of bond amongst each other.

Aside from connectivity, social media has been an essential platform for educational purposes. It makes learning easier and more accessible for many people. One-click away and

Aside from fake news, many people have become a victim of cyberbullying especially when it comes to public figures or celebrities that they despise. They usually create fake accounts just to hate, bully and threaten them which leads to an unhealthy environment in society.

Extracurricular should not be lesson at school since it is better to take up from people beside them. In my view, i disagree with that, because extracurriculars play a very important role and it give student have additional skills. 

The biggest reason why students should have extracurricular such as cookery, dreemaking and woodwork  in that extracurriculars play a very important role in the development student. In addition to important academc activities, extracurriculars provides students with opportunities to develop interests, talents and skills outside the classroom environment. For instance, In 2022, Government of Indonesia estabilished an independet curriculum with a basic program, namely  carrying out activities with students to attract children's interest. This program very innovate and creative build student readability.

 Another reason is that it helps student have additional skill different from wat the previously received when studying. The benefit of extracurricular activities at other schools is that they can be a place to train and develop students potential. Students are free to choose extracurriculars that suit your own talents and interests. For example, if they like adventure, they can join an extracurricular activity for nature lovers or scouts.

51,"In some cities, public parks and open spaces are changed into gardens where local residents can grow their own fruit and vegetables. Do you think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages?","In some urban areas , public parks and open areas  are replaced with  gardens where local people  can grow their own fruit and vegetables. Although this trend can bring advantages for local residents including, encourage people to eat healthy food. I believe demerits of this trend greater outweigh merits because it can have negative impacts on local people health, and make local people less social.  

On the one hand, the primary benefit of alter public parks and open spaces to gardens is motivate local inhabitants to eat healthy food. This is because this trend can increase availability  of fruit and vegetables for local people, which mean more a people will eat fruit and vegetables. Therefore, local inhabitants health will enhance. 

On the other hand, I would like to argue drawbacks of this development significantly far more than upsides. The first drawback of changing  public parks and open zones to gardens is can leads to adverse consequences on local people health. To illustrate, plant fruit and vegetables can attract many insects, which mean some insects can spread diseases namely, cancer, HIV, and Ebola among local inhabitants. Make local inhabitants less social is another downside of this development. This is because people often use public parks and open spaces to socialize with their friends or people on neighborhood. Consequently, replace public parks and open spaces with gardens can make local people more isolated, which this can make local people are more likely to get mental health issues namely, depression, anxiety, and stress. 

To sum up, Although altering public parks and open places to garden for  local inhabitants in order to  grow their own fruit and vegetables   can bring upsides  for local residents including, incentivies  people to eat healthy food. I think drawbacks  of this development outweigh advantages because it can have detrimental  influence on local people health, and make local people less social.","**Task Achievement: 4**

The essay addresses the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of converting public parks and open spaces into gardens for local residents to grow their own produce. However, the response lacks depth and analysis in exploring the topic. The ideas presented are somewhat superficial, and the arguments are not fully developed or supported with sufficient evidence. The essay also fails to fully address all aspects of the task, as it primarily focuses on the health benefits and social implications while neglecting other potential advantages or disadvantages.

**Coherence and Cohesion: 3**

The essay demonstrates some effort in maintaining coherence and cohesion, but the transitions between sentences and paragraphs could be improved. The flow of ideas is not always smooth, and some sentences appear disjointed or out of place. The logical sequence and arrangement of information are also not fully effective, as the essay jumps between different points without providing clear connections.

**Lexical Resource: 3**

The essay demonstrates a limited range of vocabulary. The use of words and phrases is somewhat repetitive, and there are instances of inaccurate or inappropriate vocabulary choices. For example, the use of ""make local people less social"" instead of ""reduce social interaction"" or ""promote isolation"" could be improved. The essay could benefit from a more varied and precise use of vocabulary.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy: 3**

The essay exhibits a limited range of sentence structures and grammatical constructions. The use of complex sentence structures is minimal, and the essay relies heavily on simple sentences. There are also grammatical errors throughout the essay, such as incorrect verb forms (e.g., ""can leads to"") and sentence construction issues (e.g., ""make local people more isolated, which this can make local people""). The punctuation and sentence formation could also be improved for clarity and accuracy.

**Overall Band Score: 5**

Overall, the essay demonstrates a basic understanding of the task and attempts to address the topic. However, the response lacks depth, coherence, and grammatical accuracy. The essay would benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the topic, improved organization and transitions, a wider range of vocabulary, and a more careful review of grammatical errors.",5
52,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"One of the most conspicuous things in today's world is a discussion about whether adolescents should be involved in free association. Some advocates state that youngsters can have more experiences if they do community work in their spare time. Personally, I completely agree with this statement.

To begin with, allowing youngsters to have a job in association teaches them to communicate with people effectively. To illustrate, different job categories have their standards for negotiation, this gives the opportunity for minors to convince others of the reality. It is a practice for them before they enter society and start working. Secondly, while it can be beneficial to the young generation, it is also advantageous to the neighbourhood. Namely, when there are more young-blood assimilated into the culture, companies can have a broader view of the life values of the young people and have further improvements in their business, which can boost the economy.

On the other hand, there are some voices saying that this activity could have serious negative impacts on society. The first element is that there are some juveniles who are often against the law and they may force their job peers to join them. For instance, when a person sells cigarettes illegally and he/she encourages the workers that work with him/her to join, it can be a bad effect on the district. Furthermore, if a student goes to trial in his/her free time, it might cause a decrease in academic results. If they cannot have an accommodation between work and academics, it results in poor school results.

In conclusion, even though it is stated that there are some detrimental effects regarding this statement, I firmly believe that it would be more beneficial for both minors and society.","**Task Achievement:**

53,More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people say that the price increase of fattening foods will solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the new era, a growing issue of people becoming dangerously overweight. To solve the above problem, one school of thought holds that some people propose increasing the cost of high-calorie foods. While I accept that their perception is somewhat justifiable, I believe that individuals should also be self-conscious about their own weight status.

On the one hand, the growth of fattening food prices is applied as a public policy in each country that could be beneficial to their society as a whole. This is because payable cost fluctuations affect people's consumption. Consumers tend to choose products based on their budget, so an increase in the payable cost of a product contributes to a decrease in consumer purchasing. However, fatty foods are mostly essential commodities, even if they increase, they are still affordable for families. For instance, according to a survey conducted by the Department of Consumer Protection, KFC fried chicken stores in Vietnam have increased their prices five times in a recent decade. Especially, its sales have not decreased, on the contrary, it has increased eight times since 2014. As a result, it is difficult to say that it helps to limit obesity in the community.

On the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that individuals should also be responsible for their weight status. First, each person must raise their awareness of products that they will buy and use. For example, consumers can look at the amount of fat recorded on the label of packages before purchasing to ensure their nutritional needs are in each meal. Furthermore, a healthy diet should be a considerable choice for every family, such as a combination of fibre, fats, and carbohydrates. We know that fat is also an important nutrient that has been proven necessary for the human body. Therefore, if it is removed from the menu, it is not necessarily a good thing.

In conclusion, whilst it is irrefutable that increasing the price of fattening foods is a simple solution to the problem of individuals becoming overweight, I would contend that it fails to address the root causes of the issue and some they should put effort into adjusting their diet.","**Task Achievement:**

54,"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other thinks it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views","There has been a heated controversy on whether high school students should be free to evaluate and criticise their educators. While some people think that disrespect and indiscipline are the unavoidable aftermath of this approach, I would contend it would result in increased educational quality.


On the one hand, there is a common belief that enabling students to judge teachers may undermine students’ sense of respect and discipline. High school students are generally immature, inexperienced and impulsive; they tend to lose their temper and overreact each time they are disciplined by the teachers. The problem is even worse when all the students see their peers criticising the teachers. They may think of such action as a right way to behave and start to imitate it. As a result, the classroom learning environment can be filled with disrespect and indiscipline.


On the other hand, I side with those who believe that giving students the total freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings towards teachers may enhance educational standards. Many countries are promoting students-centred teaching with two-way communication, where open discussions between teachers and students are encouraged. This approach has a clear advantage of making students become proactive in studying. It also provides teachers with a chance to better their pedagogical skills by receiving feedbacks from students. By this way, both the learners and the educators can achieve higher academically.


In conclusion, the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers may undoubtedly lead to enhanced academic achievements, despite the possibility that a disrespectful and undisciplined attitude amongst the class.","**Task Achievement:**

55,Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would be benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.Do you agree or disagree?,"People hold different views on whether teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help their nation's society.  As far as I am concerned, my agreement outweighed the disagreement.

To begin with, doing work without a salary can easily cause boring and exhausting for  teenagers. This is because  they need to do the work for a long time without receiving any money when they can use their leisure time doing their hobbies or relaxing after school. As a result, this may lead to conflicts between the youth and their local government. An obvious example is that in many countries because the teen is requested to do voluntary work too much without remuneration, a lot of demonstrations have occurred. The reason for this is that they feel stressed when doing unpaid work.

However, by participating in unpaid work, can gain a large amount of  valuable experience before applying for a job. This can be explained by when commencing a job at an early age, they can have more time to do their work and gain knowledge which would be useful for their future employment. In addition, businesses could  benefit when the amount of money they need to invest in training  beginners will be decreased when they have a large of experience before doing a job. As a result, more money will be spent to increase the product's quality so that local people can buy them at an affordable price. For instance, nowadays many businesses accept the young who do voluntary tasks, this is because less time  is needed to train them and they can use that to enhance the quality of the products and gain more profit.

56,Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In parallel with the incredible development of technology, online curriculum has become one of the common features of university education, which is gradually replacing face-to-face classes. From my perspective, this movement brings about both positive and negative impacts to students.

On the one hand, offering online courses is considered to be very essential to students who always up to the ears with full-time learning schedule, especially those living far from the hall. In other words, online courses offer learners a flexible time to attend the lesson so that they can postpone the lessons to do their job or arrange it easily in their busy timetable without any worries about missing courses taught in the campus. This is extremely advantageous for students who have part-time job, which helps lighten their financial burden. Moreover, by purchasing online courses, students can have an access to the unlimited sources of accurate information which are provided by host academy. Thus, it is very beneficial for students who are seeking for crucial information for their essay, as well as those who slow on the uptake can replay the lesson as many times as they want.

On the other hand, online education still has some vital disadvantages which merely traditional classes can afford. Firstly, it is impossible for students to interact directly with their tutors and peers, which plays an integral part in their understanding the lessons. This is due to the large number of students studying online, it is time-lacking for both students and professors to communicate with each other. Secondly, the online learning solution requires lots of self-discipline to become effective, which just a small number of students can make it. For instance, first things may appear on the top are gaming badges, media, following are notifications from Facebook and pop-up advertises, which are real nuisances to the learning process.

In conclusion, having online tertiary education as an alternative choice is beneficial to some students. However, I think that the drawbacks are harmful in the long run and it should be taken into account.","**Task Achievement:**

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that volunteer work should be considered as the best way to utilize leisure time by the modern generation for the goodwill of society and themselves. In my opinion, this trend can have positive impacts on the community as well as youngsters. 

To commence with, working without salary benefits youngsters in many ways. Firstly, individuals can learn many skills while doing community work such as time management, teamwork and leadership. This is because they have to deal with numerous problems where these skills are required. Apart from that gaining valuable work experience and skills may be useful for acquiring a job of their personal choice. Moreover, teenagers can get a chance to meet new people and learn about different cultures which is the best usage of their free time.

At the societal level, it also contributes to the betterment of the community as well. Volunteer workers can help to keep the cities clean by collecting garbage and cleaning the natural resources of the water. In addition, it may help to improve the economy of the nation without spending extra money. For instance, governments have to spend a lot of money on hiring new employees if no one prefers volunteering.

58,Nowadays many job seekers are finding jobs that force them to move for from their family and friends. Is it a positive or a negative trend? What can be done about it?,"To begin with, a lot of people believe they can earn higher incomes by working overseas. As a result, living standards and economic conditions for their families will improve, especially for people who migrate to developed countries from third world countries. There are, by comparison, other negative aspects that people should remember. The family members have a chance of a cultural shock, because there could be certain rituals and practices that do not suit them. To overcome this problem, families should learn common language about the land to which they are going. It will minimize the ""cultural shock"" and help avoid unpleasant accidents. Family members should also have an idea about the country's laws and rules prior to travel. This should avoid law-related issues. Photography of government buildings or monuments, for example, is a criminal offence in some countries.
Second, living far away from your loved ones could cause depression in some people. It takes time to get to know an area and make friends, particularly at the start, so people begin to feel lonely. For example, if the person is older, beginning a relationship becomes much harder, because everyone else has already established their social circles.

way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that some people argue that instead of trying to stop climate change, we should learn to live with it. I completely disagree with this statement, because this issue is having a huge effect on the environment and we have to come up with ways to reduce it before it does serious damages to our planet.

It is true that technology developments will cause the loss of traditional cultures. I agree with this view because technology doesn't seem to be affecting other cultures.

It is true that the definition behind traditional and religious festival has been forgotten by many people, since nowadays most people only want to enjoy themselves. Although I am not against people having a good time, I completely disagree with the meanings of these festivals being forgotten.(all these festivals have special meanings and should not be forgotten)

In varies countries, a small amount of people earn extremely high salaries. While it is the belief of some people that this is beneficial for the country, I believe that salaries should be kept at a certain level.(everybody deserves equal pay)

It is believed that an academic degree leads to future job opportunities. I agree with the given assertion while there are also some other underlying reasons involved in this respect.  

I agree with the view that the importance of academic qualifications to find a good job cannot be ignored. It seems that university graduates are more likely to be recruited by other companies. That is to say, businesses show tendency to employ staff with academic backgrounds, since they have had theoretical information which is a basic need to start a career. Take a young person who has recently graduated, and had learned a various array of subjects related to his academic field as an example; this leads him to find more appropriate job with more favourable revenue. 

In addition, there are contributing factors that can be considered beneficial to get a more satisfying job. 

Firstly, if individuals attend courses related to their field to attain experience, they are more likely to be welcomed by more firms. Secondly, personal quality is an element that by no meant cannot be neglected. More precisely, those who work on their personal characteristics such as being well-mannered, responsible, and hardworking are more likely to be far more successful in the job market, and employers place a premium on this workforce. 

To conclude, I agree that having a satisfactory job requires academic qualifications, practical skills as well as productive qualities.","**Task Achievement:** 3.5/4.0

60,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The natural environment is harmed as a result of increased consumer goods manufacturing. The main reason for this is that the products which involve chemical materials are harmful to the environment and a viable solution is to make strict laws to protect the environment. 

First of all, one of the first problems of that the number of people consuming increases year after year, and some of them consume more than they need. In the other words, when people consume more products, they become product more goods. In addition, all manufacturers want to meet the demands of their consumers. As more goods are produced, toxic wastes are released from factories into nature. For example, more single-use products are introduced, most of which are non-biodegradable.  These products can remain as waste for thousands of years,  turning our planet into a huge landfill.

A solution that is some measures should be taken by the government. Manufacturers also  should be encouraged to use eco-friendlier materials. For example, the WWF which is a famous brand in Turkey has recently replaced nylon and polyester clothes with reusable alternatives made of materials like cotton or wool. Thus, the clothes which are produced by WWF can be recycled.

62,"Some people think the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","When there are good quality education nations dominantly flourish ethically as well as  technologically which help to boost state wealth and create an ideal society. It is thought by many individuals that the basic aim of the institution is to make youngsters fine residents and professionals instead of giving them an advantage personally. I would argue in the favor of the mentioned statement and will further explain the reasons behind this.

There are many reasons to support this notion. To begin with, For teens the first learning place as a learner are academies. Since children are being started edification at a very early age, which is the finest period for them to pick the positive and negative aspects of the surrounding easily. Furthermore, They will always go with the same thoughts throughout  life as this era is the best for their mental grooming. To illustrate, According to my country local survey, 80% of the people who are keener to follow laws are universities graduates.

Secondly, The other reason for concurring with this statement is, As institutes are using modern pedagogy along with brand new techno appliances for practical work. Moreover, these teaching methods allow them to learn new developments in science and using this modern equipment make them more skilful and well rounded. Additionally, such people could go easier in their professional careers later on. To cite an example, the National University of science and technology, Pakistan is using modern lab experiments during academic tenure,devoting 70% of the workforce to the multinational companies functioning inside the country compare to other state institutions.

To sum up, I completely agree with this statement that the main purpose of educational institutes is to make  teenagers good dwellers and prepare excellent personal. This is due to schools being the early place for children to be interacted with and these tuition centres are using modern teaching ways to create a workforce. Given this situation, It seems that authorities need to provide vast educational networks and make sure to give access to each citizen to the cheapest education.","### Task Achievement:

63,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.  To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is believed that adolescents should be involved in community work during leisure time and  that can benefit them and the community. I agree with the statement as teenagers can benefit  by having sense of responsibility at young age and that may help reduce the rate of juvenile  crime in community.  By participating in social work, many young adolescents are instilled with a sense of  responsibility. Instead of involving in illegal activities during free time, teenagers who join  community work tend to be more responsible to their community and country. For instance,  activities such as cleaning the compounds around orphanage and old folks can make them feel  more engaged into helping unfortunate people. Subsequently, young adolescents may possess  a sense of responsibility towards their community.  Secondly, increased in teenagers who are responsible among the population could reduce the  rate of juvenile crime in the community. Many young adolescents are involved in crime activities  all over the country as they are not exposed to such activities since young. As a result of  participating social activities, there are high possibilities to mitigate the occurrence of crimes  such as vandalism, pickpocketing, robberies in community. Thus, the juvenile crime rate in the  community eventually reduced with well raised teenagers.

64,"Many countries spend large amounts of money on preparing competitors in major world sporting events such as the Olympic Games and football World Cup.  Instead, this money can be spent on encouraging children to take up sports at a young age.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Investing in sports is an important part of the government’s business to improve the physical fitness of the population, particularly young children. While it is necessary to train a few selected individuals to compete in major world sporting events, the government should do more to provide young people with plenty of fun activities. There are a myriad of benefits to be gained from funding sports participation at grass-root levels and excellence in performance at elite levels.
To begin with, to motivate children to be physically fit, they should be physically active with a lot of fun at grass-root levels, and the key is investing in a variety of sports facilities.  Whatever their fitness personality, all young children can be physically fit through enjoying regular exercise, if only for the fun of it..  Generally speaking, if children start doing sports early enough, they will come to regard physical activity as a normal—and fun—part of everyday routine. The point is keeping the focus on fun because young children will not do something they do not enjoy.  If they enjoy a sport, they will do more of it; on the contrary, if they do not, they may be bored and frustrated and therefore reluctant to exercise. This shows why money should be spent on giving fun opportunities to children who begin taking up sports at an early age.
At elite levels, it is not a waste of money when it comes to preparing competitors in major world sporting events because athletes are allowed to experience the winning spirit of competition on the global stage. For that matter, every government has a duty to spend money on helping its people fulfill their potential, and such events as the Olympics and World Cup can give athletes a goal and young people a chance to believe in themselves. At this point, the question arises about the wisdom of a country (with limited resources) spending too much money and not getting a good return on investment, suggesting that this money should be put elsewhere instead. Although the answer to the question depends on who you ask, there is evidence that investing in elite athletes is gaining support from a country’s people who like to see their stars shining in international competitions. That in turn is an encouragement for young children to do sports at an early age.
In terms of policies, a county has nothing to lose when spending huge money on encouraging young children to be engaged in physical activities at grass-root levels as well as on preparing competitors at elite levels.  Both policies are worth investments from the government. And neither is a losing business.","**Task Achievement: (4)**

65,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"One might think that enforcement of mandatory community service by youths during their free hours will be beneficial to them and the community. I highly disagree with this opinion, because teenagers have the right to choose which skill they want to progress in their free time. In addition to that, community development is the responsibility of the government.

Freedom to select what interesting thing to do on the youths precious time can further motivate them to excel. This is because every person is unique and has various points of preference. It drives them to invest time and focus in achieving certain tasks. A better approach is to present the tasks and programs that can help them hone their present skills. For example youths with anti-social behaviour, it will be unfair for them to be required to work in a community that requires social skills. Anti-social presons can be productive in solitary jobs like computer programming.

Obviously, teenagers development through forced labor in the community will never be productive for them. Since this is carried out in a way that youths dont have a choice, results are expected to be in low compliance. Only a low percentage of this age-group can tolerate uncompensated labor, most of them spends their time in social gatherings, games and even sports. In contrast, youths who work usually would expect to have salaries, as this will be the motivating factor for them to buy their needs and wants at this stage in life. As an example, nowadays, highschoolers are active with social media, they spent a huge number of hours on these platforms, learning, communicating, and at times take advantage to earn extra money, that is why community work will be the least option for them.  

In conclusion, there are much better alternatives in honing the youth, among those options, community required jobs are not the best. Teenagers can be productive and beneficial to the community by doing things where they excel and enjoy the most.","**Task Achievement:** [6]

On the one hand, studying at a university or college has a variety of benefits for students. They will have degrees and knowledge after graduating. It leads to the increase of job opportunities to get a well-paid job. Moreover, spending four years at university or college helps students improve their presentation skills and their confidence.

There are adequate evidence are obtainable to substantiate reasons. The top-notch concrete is attending co-educational school, which makes children should treat everyone equally with respect and care.

A primary reason is children can distract by other things which affect performance in academic records. For instance, boys had affection toward women which lead to many problems. Furthermore, women feel more comfortable and safer  studying in single-sex academic institutions. Hence, it's apparent why many are in favour of this trend.

69,Some people think that money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The technology from the very beginning has two aspects, if it is used in the right way it is beneficial for survival, but if it is utilized in the wrong way it may be worse for the whole mankind. A  popular stratum of society believes that spending wealth in the development of space exploration is necessary. However, in its sharp contrast, others opine that it is the sheer wastage of money which could rather be used to eradicate other issues of the community. I would like to delve into both the arguments before making an opinion.

The first school of thought claims that evolution of space technology has brought humans the possibilities of life in outer space, which is a huge achievement. According to some researchers, the end of the earth can be expected as a consequence of factors like pollution, global warming, etc. So, the space scientists are working on projects to produce habitat on other planets. They believe that without exploring the space or other planet physically we cannot have any idea about it. Moreover, without having prior knowledge of other spheres we cannot live there. In addition to this, developing space technology is compulsory.

However, another group of person opines that spending wealth on space technology is surely a wastage of it. Every year a huge amount of money is spent on this by different countries to just prove their strength. They believe that as we live on earth humans should not face problems in their daily life to run their lives smoothly. Instead of spending too much money on space exploration program e governments should spend on social issues. For example, governments should provide jobs for their pupil, they should construct better infrastructure  for better development, they should provide better medical facilities and much more.

In the conclusion, I would conclude that developing automation for space exploration is good for mankind, but this fact cannot be denied that it requires a huge amount of fund. The governmental bodies should also keep a regular check on social issues to bring happiness into people's lives and on planet earth.","## Task Achievement:

Although the existence of robot to help a certain business give more benefit to the owner,  it will create more social issues in society.

71,"Some people think that parents should tell stories or read to their children. However, others believe that these days this isn’t necessary as children have so many other sources for stories, such as books, films and TV. 

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There is opinion that stories should be told to children by their parents. But some individuals believe that it is not need for children, because it has many sources so the child do not know to choose. My opinion is children can listen or read without the help of parents.

 The first reason, children should learn to read stories without adults. Nowadays, parents are busy their job. So their children can learn the ability to understand for their children. Furthermore, animated films have been provided speech stories for children. 

Even if parents have enough time to take care their children or reading stories they love. They can not save many different stories that these film provide.

 However, I believe that children listen the story that their parents read fo them. It is the good way to connect emotion and a good education. Affection will arise when mom and dad give love to their children  with the help of storytelling.

In this essay, I will explain  some major reasons behind this trend as well as how to search for related instruction. 

To begin with, a group of individuals are very interested in the background past of where they live. Firstly, having as much as possible information about a residence record in various items like the quality of its original materials and its durability over time makes the current owner of the house aware of the possible weaknesses and how to deal with them with regard to the previous possessor’s experiences. for example, a building made of strong materials and a history of good standing against environmental problems, especially destructive storms, could be a reliable place to live in harsh conditions. Secondly, some folks have special beliefs in Supernatural beings and their power to influence humans’ daily life lives. Thus, they might search for anything related to their concerns before buying a residence. For instance, if these people find out a building has so-called hunted in the past by some supernatural creatures, they would definitely hesitate to purchase it.

There are numerous ways in order to get a dossier almost about any topic. Firstly, it can be searched on social media and some platforms such as Google in order to gather data about the place they want to know. Secondly, asking  some of the old residents in neighbourhood neighbourhood could be a good idea as well.

74,In some countries celebrities complain about the way media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree ?,"Media is playing an important role in our lives by publishing news through e-media or printed ones. Especially, when the media gives exaggerated focus on the personal lives of  famous people, sometimes it's  a curse for them. However, a few people believe that every celeb should bear with it as it's a part of their fame. I personally disagree with this statement. My inclination shall be explained in upcoming paragraphs.

There are many factors why publishing too much  news about celebs' personal lives should not be part of their fame. The primary one is it is harmful to people as well as those famous people. By that I mean, it diverts people’s attention away from  important topics such as politics, business or the environment. For Instance, the public knows more about Salman Khan and his broken relationship than the political issues. Apart from that, celebrities' bad actions or habits sometimes become negative inspirations for the public. For example, If some celebs drinks and smokes, it is copied by many youngsters as they think it's  glamorous to do so.

Furthermore, sometimes media also creates a detrimental effect on stars. In other words, when paparazzi follow them everywhere, it breaks down their peace of mind. They can not enjoy themselves like the common man, at  one ,point it will be stressful for them and their career also suffers. For example, a famous actor Sushant Shigh died because followed by the paparazzi.

However, the counterpart argues that it is part of their status. Mainly, famous person followed by many people as role models and want to be like them, that is why they want to know each and every detail about their personal lives. Moreover, Sometimes celebs themself want to be covered by the media all the time in order to survive in the cut-throat competition of this entertainment world. In this way, they can build their fame and gradually this becomes part of their life. But, this does not mean the media has all the right to publish anything about them, especially about their relationship or private movement of life, just to grab more public attention and increase their customers.

To conclude, although, stars are idols of many people and fame should be maintained by the media to survive in their careers, I believe, publicizing their personal lives is stressful, distracts people and gives some bad habits to  youngsters. Also, as human rights they can keep the privacy of their life and need not  share all the stuff, Media should also know where to draw the line.","### Task Achievement:

76,A lot of old people are suffering from lonliness these days. They also lack physical fitness. What do you think are the reasons for this problem. Can you think of some possible solutions.,"Nowadays a number of old people experience anxiety and prefer living in solitude rather than expressing their fears. As a result, they keep away from crowded areas, seldom stepping out for any physical activities thus spending a majority of their time indoors. Two of the majors reasons could be addiction to social media and age related problems. Two of the possible solutions are to disconnect from the virtual world and spend some time in the real world along with indulging in some light physical activities.

These days people spend most of their time surfing social media sites and crave validation along with trying to compare their lives with others. If they are lacking certain beauty standard or skills that are portrayed online many go into depression and isolate themselves from the world thus resulting in loneliness.

People failing to keep up with these trends consider themselves to be failures and sometimes even contemplate suicide as they are unable to keep up with the pressure.


 
An important solution is to restrict the time spent online and meet and interact with more people around. Time limit should to be set for accessing social media and outdoors activities should be given paramount importance. According to a recent study many people felt less depressed and revitalized when they went for a jog or run as the fresh air and boost in blood flow increased their energy. Moreover, participating in outdoor activities helps you meet new people and enables you to share ideas and strategies for the well being of the team.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Several specialists think that when a nation is already prosperous, an added richness to the economy makes the people not satisfied anymore. This essay disagrees with this point of view.

In the current state of the global economy, wealthy states should never run out of funds for the welfare of the citizens. Therefore, I disagree with the thought that additional wealth will just make people unsatisfied. Moreover, it should always be the goal of rich countries to gain more in order to provide services for their people such as education, health, and entertainment. In the last two years, the whole world was devastated by the pandemic, and no one was spared. In fact, the global economic state was put into perils.

Moreover, many things had happened also in the past and no one can even predict the future. With the updated technologies and increased population, a more prosperous country should continue to invest and collect more financial profits to make the nation stable for the future. Furthermore, it is not to think that richer countries are greedy, but it is the fact that it got resources and backup for their people's needs. Famines, wars, and other pandemics can happen anytime in the future, and countries like the United States is expected to always extend their financial aids to those poorer ones. 

To summarise everything that has been stated so far, it is paramount for the wealthier and prosperous states to continue access to a lot more financial resource because it improves the economic stability of the country in the many more years to come.","**Task Achievement:**

78,Some people think that climate change could have a negative effect on business. Other people think that climate change could create more business opportunities. Discuss both views give your own opinion,"Climate change is considered one of the most urgent and devastating topics that need an immediate action from everyone, world leaders, experts, and common people to find sustainable solutions.

To begin with, throughout the years, several elements had a negative impact on the environment which contributed to the climate change crisis. Such as the greenhouse effect and waste products. And it is worth mentioning that human beings have the lion's share of this dilemma. However, it is up to us to find the solutions to save our motherland and minimize the damage we have done so far.

Looking closely at climate change and what it holds of unfavourable outcomes for humankind I have to say that I agree that it will badly affect businesses ,especially in the long term. Looking at farms for instance, farmers will face a difficult time in planting seeds due to environmental changes , which, in turn, they will not be able to provide their products to the farmer markets, as a result, both the farmers and the sellers will face financial difficulties. Another example is industrial processes, if we didn't find alternative resources that hold lower negative impacts than today's resources, then, a lot of workers in factories will be at risk of losing their jobs.

 Having said that, I do not think that it will create more job opportunities. I can understand that some people think of this idea as a good opportunity but I think they only are looking at the short term.

80,"Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have contrasting views about what would be the ultimate goal of an educational institution. While some people opine that school should prepare their pupils as a productive member of society, I think they also should help these children to grow as a person meanwhile.

Firstly, preparing children for employment will ensure their livelihood. If youngsters are provided market-based lectures & environments on their campus, it will create their base for professional life. Consequently, they will be competent by gaining the required knowledge and skills for being recruited by companies or start entrepreneurship. Thus, getting ready for future jobs at an early age helps the children to grasp opportunities in the future and earn their bread and butter. For example, in Bangladesh, the employment rate is 30% higher for the candidates who had graduated from the vocational training centre compared to general.

However, developing children's personality will make them a happy person. An individual may be very successful in life by having a progressive career, yet he may be unhappy and depressed for other internal concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on child cognitive development and improvement of their interpersonal skill so that they could be able to make effective communication, differentiate right and wrong & tackle difficulties. As these young people spend a long time in school, soft skills would be effectively inculcated by them if they are being taught these in the classroom. For instance, punctuality and discipline, two vital qualities a pupil learn from their classroom, which benefits them life-long.

In conclusion, whether making students for future occupations or better characteristics should be the main target of an educational institution is a controversial issue. I think both should be the purpose of a teaching centre for building a complete personality.","## Task Achievement:

81,Whether or not someone achieve their aims is mostly by a question of luck. To what  extent do you agree or disagree,"Many people claim that luck is the most crucial element contributing to a person's  success. While I accept that luck does have an important role in helping people reach  their targets, I would argue that hard work and determination are much more crucial  factors leading to the achievement of an individual.  On the one hand, I agree that luck can be an important factor. First, some people are  fortunate enough to be born in a wealthy family, which allows them to have better  education or to easily start their own business without having to borrow money from  someone else. As a result, these people tend to have better opportunities to succeed  than those coming from poor families. Furthermore, some individuals are lucky to be  given great talents which others do not have. For example, Mozart was able to play  music when he was very young, or Lionel Messi already had great football skills when  he was born.  However, I would argue that although luck can be necessary, it is not the most crucial  a factor leading to success. Firstly, people need to work really hard and put much effort  into their jobs if they want to be successful. For instance, before becoming one of the  best football players in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo had to go through intense training  hours every day for many years. Secondly, a person is less likely to reach his targets if  he does not have determination. On the way leading to success, there might be many  difficulties, and people need to keep moving forward to overcome those challenges.  In conclusion, while I agree that luck is important to some extent in helping people  become successful, I believe that hard work and determination are the most important  elements","**Task Achievement:**

82,It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as squares and parks. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?,"People have different views about the open areas such as squares and parks play a vital role in towns and cities. This essay will shed some light on why I am on the same page with those who support to this statement.

There are two reasons why it could be argued that public grounds should not be considered as the heart of the cities. The prominent reason is that the number of people migrate to cities increases remarkably due to overpopulation, so these metropolitans do not have available spaces to construct parks or squares. Hong Kong, where inhabitants even do not possess enough places for establishing accommodation, can be taken as an object lesson. Besides, the national authorities should expend the budget on other prospects such as healthcare, education and transportation systems instead of open spaces. 

Although the drawbacks of huge spaces are inevitable, their advantages are more significant. Firstly, public places are the ideal places for local citizens improving their well-being and lifting up their spirit. Particularly, residents tend to have stroll around these places to release stressful things after their hectic daily schedules, which can do wonder for them to recharge the battery. Secondly, the deterioration of air quality becomes an alarming trend in cities, so green regions such as parks are able to contribute to the environmental protection by diminishing the amount of greenhouse gases. Moreover, squares also preserve historical value that boosts the tourism industry through attracting visitors flock into this area annually.

84,"""The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?""","With urbanisation, the population in cities is growing fast and so is the housing crisis, which brings along many other problems. Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as governments can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding cities.

First and foremost, the government is the right party to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are cities on islands and they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to incorporate the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation, the government can extend highways to help commuters access the cities in a country easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve accommodation shortages for their citizenry.

Secondly, the government can help this situation by expanding cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of cities. In Noida, for instance, a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of it and built metros and highways for commuters to make it easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. 

In conclusion, it is clear that the government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking appropriate measures to create highly planned inner-by city development and well-designed infrastructure to accommodate the growing needs of their citizens.","### Task Achievement:

85,Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Our era has witnessed the explosive development of technology, and with it, the development of computer games. Gaming has become more popular among children and has become a widely debated topic. While many people state that games have negative effects on kids, others argue that there are some merits in playing video games. In the following essay, I would discuss both views of the argument and give my opinion. 

First of all, playing video games could have some downside effects and could be bad for a child’s evolution. One of those is video games containing violent scenes, which are usually seen in adventure and action games. An example of this is God of war, a game set in Greek and Norse mythology where the players use their characters to fight with gods and demons. In this game, blood is not censored and there are several cut scenes where the character’s entrail is ripped out and so on. These violent scenes could badly affect kids, as they could potentially apply the actions contained in the games to real life. Spending too much time on computer games could also create a distraction from important things in the daily life of juveniles. Children who spend too much time playing games could be distracted from studying or have their sleeping schedule messed up, thus reducing their academic performance. 

On the other hand, gaming could benefit some aspects of the development process of a child, as it improves not only critical thinking skills but also teamwork skills. Critical thinking skills could be improved through playing strategy games. For instance, when playing Age of Empires, children have to judge the strength and weaknesses of the civilization they choose, and diverse unique strategies to counter enemies and protect their base from being raided. Gaming also provides a chance to improve teamwork skills, which is an extremely valuable skill in daily life, among children. Games such as League of Legends and DOTA could be perfect examples of this, as players have to cooperate with others to defeat enemy teams and destroy their nexus. Spending time playing games could also strengthen problem-solving skills, as it would teach children to be decisive in crucial moments and create concentration power among children.

In conclusion, gaming has its own advantages and disadvantages, but the positive effects outweigh the negative effects, since playing video games helps juveniles improve their critical thinking, problem-solving and teamwork skills. But the amount of time that children spend on gaming should be limited and this process should be strictly supervised by parents to ensure kids stay away from violence and other negative effects.","### Task Achievement: 7.5

86,The best way to solve the world's environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues. While, this school of thought is valid to some extent based on reducing the number of vehicles and alleviating the exploitation of fossil fuel, I am of the opinion that there are several ways to solve environmental problems besides that measure related to rules and public awareness. 

There are a variety of compelling reasons why higher fuel costs can deal with environmental problems. Firstly, this method may decrease fuel vehicle usage and ownership. If the price of fuel, which is needed for cars to activate, people tend to swift to transportation that requires less fuel such as buses or bicycles. In 2022, many surveys have indicated that since the cost of fuel peaked after 20 years due to the war, the rate of people taking public transportation and riding bicycles increased. Secondly, higher fuel charges might lessen the exploitation. When rising the fuel price, many companies lost their interest in  investing in the process of utilizing fossil fuel. Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals. 

Despite the aforementioned benefits, I believe that some other measures can be adopted to address ecological issues. One primary approach is  raising public awareness. Government can organise presentations and events to tell the community what problems can result from deteriorating environment. Protecting the environment is not only a duty of administrations but also the public as a whole. Moreover, authorities can impose regulations to improve waste treatment and reduce pollution. They can expand the landfills and waste disposal of factories and civilizations, hence several types of pollution such as air and water are eased. 

In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution.","### Task Achievement:

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether museums are places to spend your leisure time or the main purpose is education. In this essay I am going to present both views and give my opinion. 

Some people tend to think that the most important thing of the museums is to let everyone relax and enjoy, because it will let them overcome stress. One of the first things we need to take into consideration is that modern society have enough pressure in everyday life and information flow in erroneous, it all can even lead to depression, that’s why visiting cultural places like that may help to deal with it.

Modern technology is taking place over the world and people tend to spend their free time online rather than visiting museums, it mostly affects teenagers that’s why majority of them aren’t versed in history and art. Some people are afraid that growing generation will have nothing to tell their descendants due to the lack of education in culture.

89,"In many countries, the government likes to spend more money on the arts. Some people agree with this. However, others think government should spend more on health and education. Discuss both sides and giver your opinion.","Providing affordable healthcare and education that can improve the quality of life is a priority for authorities. A country could invest money to offer health services that meet quality criteria. For instance, senior medical staff spends extra money to improve the quality of care and patient safety by reducing maternity and newborns mortality caused due to inadequate medication or unhygienic infrastructure. Administration in educational institutions consumes money to make it more accessible to a well-developed education system. That is to say, preparing a structured curriculum and hiring professional teachers contribute mainly to graduate skilled alumni for decent job opportunities. Thus, quality national health coverage and education boost public health and employability.


However, education and health are not more crucial than the arts. Art illustrates great importance in self-expression and fulfillment. In other words, art is the same as the language in describing imagination and ideas. Painting, sculpture, music, and literature are mediums that an artist chooses for his craft to convert his feelings and thoughts into tangible objects people can see and touch.

90,"In some cities people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. why is this the case? which development do you think this better?","In this contemporary era, people's preference over transportation is changing day by day. As a result, in some cities, they prefer bicycles to cars. While in other places, this trend is just the opposite. In my opinion, the former way is better than the latter. This essay shall discuss the reasons for this changing trend. 

On the one hand, the world as a global village is aware of the rising pollution level and the majority are concerned about its impact on the environment. This concern plays a major role when it comes to choosing bicycles instead of cars. For example, recent studies conducted in the USA has shown an increase in bicycle usage by 10% compared to last year. However, this change in attitude is mainly seen in developed countries as the majority of the population is literate and can easily acknowledge the future consequences of pollution. 

In addition to the above, nowadays everyone is concerned about their well-being and riding a bicycle is a proven way to improve and maintain physical fitness. Moreover, it gives them a choice to choose between health and comfort . For instance, those who choose fitness over convenience is proven to have  better health of the heart and even the Canadian president commute to his office using a bicycle. Even though only a few  are properly  following the trend. 

On the other hand, people choose their comfort over health and the environment by prioritising car as a mode of transport. Consequently, the traffic blocks increase along with air and noise pollution. For example, the level of carbon monoxide in Delhi is higher than in any other place in India as a result of plummed usage of private vehicles. Although it provides greater convenience , the damage it does to the environment is immeasurable. 

To conclude, I reiterate that, it's better to choose a pollution-free mode of transport like bicycles to provide a better tomorrow for the future generation. This can only be achieved through raising constant awareness among the public.","**Task Achievement: 8.5**

91,"Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?
","
It is true that some people believe that cross-national cooperation is the only measure that can be tackled the majority of the emergent issues. While I accept that this may suit many people, I believe that not all of acute problems can be coped with international organizations.
	On the one hand, it is widely agreed that many issues have reached a global level and only through the cooperation of a wide range of countries can be addressed. Firstly, global warming is an increasing concern for human around the world. For example, the famous Kyoto Protocol is the result of international cooperation, which has been implemented for many years in an attempt to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. Secondly, our world is facing to lots of terrorism, there are many murders and bombing which need worldwide support and assistance. For instance, multi-national cooperation need to tackled terrorist acts from the Islamic State (IS), which has taken the lives of many innocent people in the world.
	On the other hand, most of alarming problems can solely be coped with the local authorities. First, education, health and poverty can only be solved by their own governments. In particular, the global support’s aid is temporary, therefore the governments have to implement the good policies to develop their countries, give poor people chance to improve their standard of living. Furthermore, corruption is the urgent issues that can only be deal with the independent development and reform of individual countries. The international organization has no authority to inquiry a country’s government, which can only be prevented by the local residents and officials.
	In conclusion, while cross-national organization is an effective way in dealing with many of acute problems, it seems to me that there are also a large number of urgent issues that require the domestic resolution and action instead of a global support.

92,"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","Nowadays it seems to be a common trend that people decide to get children at a later age than in the past. But is this advantageous?

Previously women mainly had two duties; childbirth and raising offspring. They were wed at early ages and gave birth usually before becoming sixteen years old. In those days it was very advantageous. Most of the population didn’t get that old due to undeveloped medicine and the chance that the child grew up healthy was small. So the more offspring you had, the more they could provide for you later. However, all these things aren’t problems anymore in today’s society. People grow older, we have health care, pensions and kids don’t die as often.

Right now people seem to be more focused on themselves and their careers. This can be very advantageous since they are able to provide for their children so they e.g. are able to go to college. Furthermore, it helps them define more who they are and what they want in life. I have acquaintances who had kids before they were 20 and the child seemed to get in the way of their own life sometimes. They still want to travel, see the world and discover new cultures, which is harder when you have a child both from a financial and practical aspect.

Nevertheless, there are also disadvantages when people get pregnant later in life. The main problem is the health issues for females in labour. After 30 years old their bodies become less capable of giving birth and the chance of complications gets higher.

93,Young people who commit crimes should be treated in the same way as adults who commit crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argue that criminals that are minor should undergo the same treatment as adult criminals and, this essay shares the same opinion with their argument.

To begin with, there are some negative points in that argument. First and foremost, underage criminals might not fully understand the consequences of their crimes. To be specific, it is wrong to commit a crime in the first place but, there is a big difference between people committing a crime despite fully understanding the impact of crime and who do not. Underage criminals, considering their immature nature, are more likely, in the latter group. Moreover, It can be harsher punishment compared to adult criminals. To elaborate, younger criminals have more days to live after the punishment and, it would be difficult for them to be employed considering their formal convict status.

However, there are also some positive points to the argument. Firstly, the age of criminals does not change the severity of crimes. There is a reason for the Justice system installed a statue with a blindfold. It represents the just system should be fair and equal. Secondly, it can be unfair to the victims of the crime. For instance, there would be a situation where people who lost their family member to a minor might have to watch the convict gets away with relatively weak punishment.

Which is provide them quality education as well as better job opportunity. Secondly, specific courses are only available in some universities. Universities use more and more marketing trick. Which influance the student to get enroll in that perticular institute. Lastly this phenomina has its own positive and negative effects.

It is benificial for nation as well as society because the educated person contribute for nation and society development. For getting admission in university student always focused and goal oriented. Some time nation has not to depend on other coun try to get desire candidate. But also there are also some negative side of this trend which effects somany student and their family.

Some time it happen that when a student does not get admission in desire university . They demotivated and some are suffer from mental illness or try to suiside attamp. Due to these compitation some collages or universitied increase their financial stracture which effect students family. And some universities are only develope good infrastracture and the quality of education is lessar then require. So, these are dark side of these trend.

Lastly to conclude that the good university or degree does not require for better life or achive goals.

So, as per my point of view this development is negative for people.","### Task Achievement:

95,"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Global warming is certainly the problem of the new millennium. The Major cause for this is the overuse of fossil fuels. The natural sources under the Earth's surface are used in various ways. However, the main demand is for the production of plastics and for vehicles. One of the suggested solution is the rise in the cost of this material. Although this could lower the consumption, I believe that this would not confront the current problem.
The usage of fuels created water and air pollution. Gas is commonly used in cars, which significantly increased the contamination of the air. Boats are major problem for water pollution, as they realise an enormous amount of oil into the ocean. Above that most of the plastics ends in the sea, endangering animals' lives. Rising the cost of fuels might lower the usage, but not prevent the global warming. Higher prices would not stop industries from trading and producing plastic materials. It would rather create greater monopoly and increase the gap between the rich and the poor. 
To solve the environmental issue, in my opinion, more attention should be pointed towards renewable resources. Lowering the costs in the latter would increase the usage of it even among the middle and the low-rank. Taking electric cars as an example, that do not realise any toxic gases, making them affordable would help reducing the air pollution. In addition, the government of each country should create standards for natural, renewable resources, defying how much renewable energy must be created per year.
In conclusion, the global warming is a huge issue, that must be confronted. Since the major cause for it is the high demand for fossil fuels, many believe that with the increase in costs would reduce the problem. I believe this is not the case and to truly solve the problem the renewable energy should become more affordable.","## Task Achievement:

96,"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The role of schools in shaping individuals and citizens is a subject of debate. While some prioritize molding good citizens and workers, a balanced approach must also prioritize empowering students as unique individuals.

  Schools have a crucial responsibility in fostering good citizens. Through subjects like history and civics, students learn about social responsibility, diversity, and global issues. This cultivates a sense of civic duty, equipping them to become active participants in society. However, solely focusing on this aspect can neglect the diverse needs and aspirations of students.

  Simultaneously, schools must prioritize the development of individuals. Nurturing creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence empowers students to excel in various fields and make unique contributions to society. Extracurricular activities, arts, and personalized learning approaches can help discover their passions and talents, fostering self-confidence.

97,"NOWADAYS, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN  IN THEIR OLDER AGE. WHAT ARE THE REASONS? DO THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS OUTWEIGH DISADVANTAGES?","In the current era, Many individuals are prone to give birth in their older age for various reasons. Personally, If individuals are at an appropriate age to have a baby, negative outcomes would outweigh the advantages.

Firstly, The main reason for having a baby in an old life in the developed world is in order to provide job security and gain a better lifestyle by generating a bunch of income. Moreover, giving childbirth at a young age not only provides a number of responsibilities to them but also reduces the freedom, which allows them to hang out with their comrades and family. For instance, from the medical surveys, 80% of mothers in an elderly life spend most of their time on hectic work due to lack of income.   

However, common abnormalities of childbirth such as Down syndrome, heart problems and other issues as a result of lower nutrition in pregnancy brings the most horrible effect which affects both mother's and offsprings' lifestyle in the short-term and long-term. Furthermore, the ability to take care of offspring at that life significantly decreases as they are too old to carry their offspring and play with them. Most medical research shows that a large number of abnormal children mostly happened in this phenomenon and mothers experienced losing childbirth before giving birth as physical issues. 

 In conclusion, Although generating income is a vital reason for some communities, people should be more concerned about this since disadvantages affect either mother or children, which leads to physical and mental issues after give-birth.","**Task Achievement:**

99,"Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future societies, while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","A school of thought has a perception that all the jobs will be done by robots in the future. In my opinion, however, the speculation is not completely true. Although the major laborious work shall be done by robots, the jobs where human intelligence and human skills are required can never be replaced by machines. This essay will discuss why not all jobs can be done with artificial intelligence.
Although, many companies are going to make systems automated, and buying most efficient and smart machines to get the jobs done to eradicate human errors. In England, for example, almost all security guards have been replaced by hi-tech security systems. Moreover, almost in all over the world, conventional banking systems have been upgraded and ATMs have been installed for cash deposit and withdrawal, the major benefit of ATMs is that they serve their purpose twenty-four hours, seven days a week without breaks. Therefore, due to the clear advantages of artificial intelligence and foreseeable accuracy and efficiency, many jobs will be taken by machines from humans in the future. 
As per my speculations, a variety of jobs will still be done by humans only, because it is impossible to completely vanish humans to develop the world. Jobs like teaching, research work, engineering, and architectural planning are just a few examples of jobs which cannot be performed by machines. For instance, the machines work on predefined algorithms installed in it, therefore, a machine can never perform a task which is not defined in its algorithm. This limitation simply indicates that a robot is made to perform a certain task and cannot play smartly if needed to perform some out of the scope job.
At last, although many of the jobs where not much pondering is required will be done by robots. This will be economical for companies, and humans will be safe to do physically hard work. On the other hand, however, certain jobs can never be done by machines and humans will always supersede machines to be on the dominant point.

100,"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A significant number of researchers negate the reciprocal relationship between the affluence of a nation and the satisfaction of citizens in that country. However, this topic has become a controversial issue, and I think that this opinion is completely unreasonable. I will explain my viewpoint in the following paragraphs. 

On the first hand, supporters of this opinion have their rational grounds. Firstly, a state is increasingly prosperous, resulting in the cost which its civilians have to pay for living. In fact, the government of Korea, which has the leading economic development rate in the world, is extremely concerned about the surge of slums in the center of Seoul. The residents of this low-income neighbourhood said that they are unable to afford the consistent growth of the expenditure for basic needs, namely food and shelter. Therefore, they must opt for a shabby home in order to save money.  Secondly, the thriving of a nation is not the only measure of one’s satisfaction. To be specific, there are countless factors to take into account such as well-being, and the care of surrounding people, and each individual has diverse measurements of his happiness. In particular, many children of wealthy families committed suicide due to the lack of freedom and the care of their parents.  

On the other hand, the above arguments are insufficient to overshadow the pitfalls of this issue. First and foremost, while the affluent of a nation is not the only element that leads to satisfaction, it still plays an important role in it. In rich countries, economic growth can improve the quality of life through better public services or social welfare. That is why developed countries, including America and England, are always the dream living locations of most individuals around the world. Besides, despite the increased cost of living, residents in thriving nations fully enjoy modern public resources such as schools. Therefore, their offspring will have access to advanced educational programs, which are better than most other nations. 

In conclusion, this opinion of some experts is plausible because of the inaccurate measurement method and negative consequences of economic development such as the elevation of the cost of living. However, the indisputable benefits of prosperous nations offset the stated arguments.","## Task Achievement:

101,Some people think that robots are very important to human’s future development. Others think that they are dangerous and have negative effects on society. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.,"In this modern era, various technologies have been developed which plays a significant role in humans life. Few individuals of society asserted that robots are imperative for the further growth of people whereas, another part of the nation racked that such machines create a number of detrimental effects on human's lives as well as on society. This essay intends to discuss both the ideology followed by my opinion and the reasons for my perspective will be elucidated in the forthcoming paragraphs with the relevant illustration.

To commence with, there are numerous advantages of robots which helps people in their future growth. First and foremost, robots work efficiently and quickly. To explicate, man made machine complete their task accurately without any interruption within a short period of time. As a result, it takes less time to execute the process. For instance, human being can work for 8 to 10 hours more effectively on the other hand robots can work full day perfectly. Hence, such technology can produce more products than employees. Therefore, it can be seen from the above point that it has various advantages which can help in the future development of the person. 

On the other hand, this technology has few repercussions due to which some part of society does not favour this notion. Firstly, it creates unemployment in the nation. To explain, when human will be replaced by robots then the opportunity for the job will be lessened. Consequently, youngsters need to face the problem of getting money for their survival. To exemplify, according to a survey conducted by London university in 2018, in topmost restaurants of Dubai robots served food to customers at their table quickly which declines the ratio of waiters by 80%. Thereby, it is great evidence that such devices will make generation jobless eventually, it will create a negative impact on mature beings' life. 

To conclude, although it has a few drawbacks such as it will be fewer job opportunity in the industries but due to having a myriad of benefits like effective and fast approach to do any task, I am in favour of those who opine that robots play a pivotal role in humans' future growth.","### Task Achievement:

102,"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

You should write at least 250 words.","It is argue by some that developed country does not require any improvement in economic sector as their societes already feel satisfy with their current condition. I personally stand to this notion since mostly people from this country have a stable life. This essay will elaborate more about this issues on the following paragraph.

Rich country typically pay attention most on some basic needs of its dwellers such as salary, tax, education and health access in order to make sure all of the citizen have same treatment. This is why their citizent have a tendency to feel satisfy as long as their basic needs is provided by government. For example Swiss is categorized as some of happiest country in the world, as a result their dwellers even with regular job living in a happy and healthy life. Thus, they do not ask for another new improvement related to economic aspect.

Furthermore, as they already living in such a wealthy living condition, people from this country put their sight more entertaining themselves. This is mostly done with spending their time on vacation, learning new things and spend some time joining social organization such as involving in charity to support other people who struggle with economic matters. For instance, people in my village, receive donation from one social organisation in Finland, which focussed more on education with providing learning material, tools, uniform and even provide healthy food once i a week.

103,"New technology has resulted in many jobs, which used to be performed by people, now being done by computers or robots. Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","The development in artificial intelalent field enable computers to conduct more and more sophistic tasks, including writing articles and collecting information in dangerous areas, which were performed by human being. Despite concerns are rise in public regarding a great amount of job opportunities is going to vanish, I personally believe it is a positive trend.

To begin with, there are various merits derived from applying modern technologies in widely professional aspects. First of all, robots which are able to replace human for doing high-risk missions, including exploring in extreme environments, could deter many safety hazards. For example, scientists nowadays are able to sent robots into deep ocean for finding new species, those robots could endure a long time remaining in the ocean, which allows researcher find more valuable data. Secondly, instead of simply complete repeatable works, AI technology nowadays are able to make a good use of its giant data base for creation. Take newspapers as an example, those reports which just simply elucidate facts are mainly done by computers, employees just need to provide key informations, such as dates and the name of people who involved in incidents. 

On the other hand, while a growing number of job positions are replaced by AI technology, some perspectives warning that it could provokes a growth in unemployeement rate. Furthermore, it will be harder for employees in the future to have a raise, since computers are able to tackle the most of hard works. However, those issues could be solved by governments with proper regulations, including providing regular financial subsidies to ensure the basic life quality of residents, and providing free services for medical cares. 

To summarise, it is inevitable that modern techonologies will demolish the majority of job positions in the future, since they are able to provide more stable and efficient services. In my perspective, even though it will cause many people lost their jobs, I still consider it as positive development, since our descendents may no longer need to work for money in the future, when technology could satisfy all the needs of human being.","### Task Achievement:

104,"In some countries, people are having children at later age in life. What are the reasons? Do the advantage outweigh disadvantages?","In today's world childbirth is a huge problem for most women.Individuals are more inclined towards making their career than on giving birth to a child.Adapting this method has more negative impacts than positive.

Firstly, the reproductive age of a woman lies between 14yrs to 40yrs.Focusing on late childbirth has caused a rise in the infertility rate.Women undergo menopause early so they need to conceive early.Late born child brings many risks to the mother like,physical weakness and mental depression.

For instance,it has been reported that women are developing many obstetric and gynaecological problems as their age advances.PCOS, has been reported as the most common cause of infertility with advancing age,so doctors are recommending parents plan their family early to avoid such issues.

On the ,contrary there are some advantages of late pregnancy.Girls should not be forced to marry early instead they should be encouraged to study further and become independent.In doing so they will be capable of looking after their kids and giving them a bright future.For example,many individuals who have persuaded their higher degrees and then married have been shown to give a healthy and good life to their future kids.

To conclude,although the merits of late birthing is completing their studies but we cannot ignore the demerits it brings and its number has been enormously increasing.The biggest threat it causes risks to the mother and many women become infertile by the time they even think of becoming a parent.In my ,opinion women should plan early to become parents than to wait till they become independent.","**Task Achievement:** The essay addresses the task by discussing the reasons for late childbirth and weighing the advantages and disadvantages.

105,"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in

What are the reasons for this? 

How can people research this?","Over the last two or three decades, computer games are being played by adolescents all around the world. Some folks deem that these hobbies have negative Impacts on teenagers while others oppose this view and consider that these pastimes own positive aspects conversely. In this essay, I will look at both sides and try to draw some conclusions.

On the one hand, there is an exceedingly increasing number of nations who insist on several negative sides of play. In other words, the majority of games guide teenagers to violent behaviours since the players have villain roles who escape from the police and kill lots of victims on their way frequently. Moreover, proven by statistics, a high amount of cruel manners are observed among computer players who enthusiastically fight with others, and hence commend to attack even their parents and as a result, it is obvious that computer games have a major role in the shocking rate of juvenile crime. 

On the other hand, a tiny minority of communities ponder that technological games have numerous creative aspects which give a helping hand to the process of teens' development. In addition, these kinds of games is designed to make children  utilize their skills at which point the process gives rise to the attraction of different skill-related parts of the brain. What's more, Doctors always maintain that they are useful to enhance cleverness among children. For illustrate, youngsters who play nearly fifteen minutes each day show more Intelligent insights rather than others, and hence youths are now brilliant because of these well-designed games. 

In conclusion, although most city dwellers especially parents are worried about the devastating effects of violent hobbies, others explain the positive Impacts on the activity of the brain. Personally, in my opinion, both views are correct to some extent but the negative side seems to be severe and gets away from control.","## Task Achievement:

A group of people claim that teenagers have to work as a voluntear, and these free tasks have a lot of benefit for socity and youths.

Free time of teenagers is a global parntal concern. In fact, effective usage of spare time in youths is very important. Because some of them use this valuable time for usfule activities, while a group of them waste it. 

Due to this condition, somebody plan to use youths power in their society. As a result of this program, teenagers start to contact with real life and get a lot of experinces.

107,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In many communities, it is accepted that young people do free work for the community. I agree that this is correct, and in this essay I will try to explain it. 

As we know, humanity has lived in communities for many years. Traditional values are passed down from generation to generation. And one of the most important qualities is the ability to work, because this is what provides people with the necessary things for their existence. The older generation of people usually teach the younger ones, because the younger ones do not yet have enough experience to do the job well. For example, many schools offer work education classes where teenagers can do useful things for the community like birdhouses for birds or prepare simple meals for charity dinners. At the same time, teenagers feel needed for society, which increases their self-esteem. 

On the other hand, they gain useful experience and knowledge. For example, the ability to cook is always useful in the future.

Discuss both views and give your opinion","While some people believe that teaching art to children is important, others, think it is just a waste of time. In this essay I will discuss why studying art is important but also why some people think the opposite.

Teaching art in schools could have a positive impact in children as it helps them to develop creativity skills that are necessary in every activity or job later in life. In fact, especially at a young age, students needs to express their emotions and characters through artistic activities. Moreover, studying ancient art as well as contemporary art might motivate some of them to become artists or art professors at university.

However, in todays world most of the job positions require a strong knowledge in mathematics. 

Because of this, it is surely more important for young students to spend more time studying other 

topics instead of learning ancient art. For example, if you are very good at math you can apply for universities such as software engineering and you will probably find a job right after your studies. In addition to that, it gives you a better salary which in turn will allow you to be indipentend at a young age.

On the other hand, there are a lot of competition and bussinesses want to make  cash to survive in a competitive world.

110,"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a  successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after  school.  Discuss both views and give your opinion.","When they finish school, teenagers face the dilemma of whether to get a job or  continue their education. While there are some benefits to getting a job straight after  school, I would argue that it is better to go to college or university.        The option to start work straight after school is attractive for several reasons. Many  young people want to start earning money as soon as possible. In this way, they can  become independent, and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family.  In terms of their career, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue  their studies, may progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real  experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead  to promotions and a successful career.         On the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their  studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For  example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having the  relevant degree. As a result, university graduates have access to more and better job  opportunities, and they tend to earn higher salaries than those with fewer  qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and  sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a company. Young  people who do not have qualifications from a university or college will not be able to  compete.        For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that students are more likely to be  successful in their careers if they continue their studies beyond school level.","**Task Achievement:**

111,Advertisements are becoming more and more common in everyday life. Is it a positive or negative development,"It has long been debated over the growing popularity of advertisements in daily life. While this phenomenon is beneficial to some extent, especially companies, I would contend that this is a negative development due to the annoyance these adverts cause to people.

It is true that the ever-growing appearance of adverts may benefit corporations. This is because the more advertisements there are, the more customers are attracted to the products they advertise, meaning that buyers are more likely to purchase these products. For example, adverts of Coca-cola, which is a carbonated sugary drink, appears on television, social networking sites, and numerous restaurants on a frequent basis, resulting in lucrative profits for Coca-Cola enterprise.

While the advantages of the growing popularity of adverts are widely acknowledged, it is unfair if its downsides are neglected, which is its annoyance. This can be explained by the fact that commercials and other forms of advertising often spring up in every corner of life, which may cause disturbance for people by hindering them from their daily activities. For example, Youtube users often have to watch a few adverts before their videos start to play, or they often have to cope with constant advertising every 15 minutes when seeing a movie on television. As a result, people are likely to get irritated and disturbed by such frequent adverts, ushering in their decisions not to purchase advertised products.

112,"Interviews form the basic selecting criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that the interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are other better methods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays numerous huge firms allocate an interview form as the basic choosing criteria. Whereas, a group of the public believe that this form is no longer up-to-the-minute and companies should not rely on them as some significant methods have developed in order to be a better choice for recruiting someone. I agree with the opinion that the employment process can reap the benefits of new methods so as to the right selection.

It is my view that, from an industrial perspective, make effective communication plays a vital role in a company’s prosperity. Therefore, having excellent interpersonal skills are more invaluable than anything else. Not only does it make a customer to be gulled to that firm and a great opportunity to make more profit but also provides a tranquil atmosphere at the workplace which results in more job satisfaction and boosts the efficiency of the employees. Hence, interview forms are not capable to illustrates this feature of a person. For example, people who do not excel at writing a letter may be ignored for a job position, although they have great communication abilities.

In contrast, some people believe that what a firm need is interview forms. They insist that applicant’s academic results are decisive factors in selecting the right person. However, I do not find this argument convincing as in this modern world experience outweighs academic learning. In addition, despite the lack of knowledge in a field, an experienced workforce can reinforce the company’s circumstances more. For example, people who have experience  selling without an academic degree are more likely to be successful compared to individuals who just hold a degree in this major.      

In a nutshell, I completely agree with making use of new methods so as to recruit a workforce because interview forms are not fully accurate and they have a lack of depicting one’s skills.","**Task Achievement:** 5.0

113,"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Young people often face the dilemma of whether to seek a job or enrol in university degrees after graduating from high school. This essay will discuss both views and into consideration.

To begin with, some people claim that starting working straight after finishing high school would give them more life experience about the work environment. They believe that learning skills while working are far better than attending college. For example, Steve - one of my friends who thought that starting working would give him more experiences and skills in real life rather than learning theories in college, and he is still able to be successful in the future. Moreover, young people want to have free and live independently instead of relying on their parents to meet their living expenses. In addition, they also can earn some saving money from the early jobs and spend them for their higher education or future career. Thus, I believe that gaining some life experiences and saving money in the early stage is beneficial for young people in the future. 

On the other hand, many people seek admission in higher education and get more appropriate knowledge for their dream job. Young people assert that university is the best place to provide them with the major of appropriate knowledge and well-preparedness, leading to a promising career. For instance, plenty of people became successful after graduating and achieved their goals in life. Furthermore, a degree makes you more competitive and gain more basic needs for your future career.

114,"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","It has been observed that  educational establishments should  provide successful passing examinations and academic achievements . However , some individuals believe that schools also create the environment for the development of minor important skills such as cookery , dressmaking and woodwork . I firmly agree with the given statement. I firmly agree with the given statement. My inclination is elaborated in the ensuing paragraph and relevant examples.

The foremost argument to justify my stand is that the main purpose of the academy is education technical or humanitarian abilities . Focusing on these aspects will sustain  well-paid jobs in the future such as engineering , economy and medicine . Moreover, all of the listed professions beneficial for all populations also serve for governmental sustainability . For instance, if schools concentrate on secondary subjects, poor progress  can be observed in students because it will take a number of time. 

Furthermore, the other reason to prove my point is educational establishments spawn scientists and training such as cooking and woodworking are obstacles to improvement of the scientific knowledge . Because of that, the academic system needs to establish optional classes for investigating drawbacks and the strong position of students . Besides, pupils are loaded with unnecessary lessons for their scientific growth . For example, if Albert Einstein's teacher had not realised the boundless potential of this genius , earth could lost the greatest physicist in history . It is obvious that, the world has numerous hidden talents and instead of focusing , universities strive to young generations with useless activities .

To conclude the discussion, my reasons are that technical and humanitarian abilities are essential and minor lessons are excessive stress and  unnecessary tension . I guess these factors are logically acceptable.","**Task Achievement: 6.0**

115,"The housing shortage in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only government action can solve this problem. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","These days as the population is increasing at an unprecedented pace, the housing shortage has become one of the main consequences. It is concerned whether it is an obligation of the government to alleviate this issue or whether the nation is responsible for the lack of accommodation. I firmly believe that both parties should integrate and contribute to the solutions. 

To begin with, there is ample evidence that sustainable housing is strongly due to government regulations. That is to say, political houses should establish certain restrictions on the numbers of people and land that is distributed to each citizen. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 25 countries had a scarcity of land to construct new houses because of the fact that government didn't allocate the land properly and residents were prone to build large houses in order to outperform one another, which later caused housing shortages in multifold metropolitan cities. 

Secondly, it is explicit that because of the nation's unprofitable purchase of lands and housing facilities, it has become prevalent to some citizens to inevitably live in flats and accommodations. It can be solved by public organisations that can share and divide some houses, which indicates that the government is not fully liable for such an issue. For example, several cities concluded that this problem is partly due to people's actions, 45 per cent of which could solve this problem by uniting both the government and the nation. 

To conclude, it can be clearly seen that I strongly advocate that it is not only feasible for the government to come up with a solution, but also citizens of the city are able to resolve the scarcity of housing.","## Task Achievement:

116,Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ??,"There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate over how to solve the negative effect issue caused by human activities on plant and animal species. While some hold a strong view that it is too late to measure the problem, the opposite makes a statement that we should enhance the situation with effective actions. I would contend that take effective actions to revamp the matters, which do more good than harm.

 It is obvious to note that there are many reasons to convince that it is too late in order to solve the negative effect of human activities on plant and animal species, one of them is deforestation. Having an ever-growing demand for land to live and wood to consume, humans decide on deforestation to serve their purpose. Therefore, it leads to flora and fauna being indiscriminately destroyed and lost completely instead of being replaced and it pushes many categories of species on the verge of extinction.  For example, Panda is China’s national treasure, but this species is on the brink of extinction because of deforestation. There is a wealth of animals in the world that are dying out because of human activities, which is the reason people doubt that it is too late to tackle the problem. 

 While the redeeming features of negative effects of human activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, we will find an address in order to enhance the issue. Plant and animal species play a paramount significant role in human’s life, so we should find a solution as soon as possible. One of the remedies is to build a reserve to create a safe habitat for endangered animals. For instance, Cuc Phuong national park in Vietnam is built and overseen by the authorities, which is home for a wave of precious animals. Hence, the situation will be resolved and revamped if people actively implement it.

To begin with, the changing climate could result in a lower production of planting.According to the research,by 2030,the total production of wheat,rice and corn may decline by almost 5%~10% due to the global warming which is a kind of climate change.Moreover,in arid areas,a great amount of engineerings in factories that require plentiful water could conceivably be forced to terminate the operation because of the lack of water source.Therefore,uncertain climate conditions presumably lead to the serious falling economy.

On the other hand,more business opportunities are potentially to be accompanied with the natural catastrophe and damages to human health.This means that more artificial food might be produced to replace the decreased plantings.What’s more,it is undoubtedly that climate change will be detrimental to individual’s health.It perhaps rises the probability of disease and death rate and thus elevates the infections.In light of this,more advanced medical machines tend to be generated and lots of relevant medical staffs are of great inportance for treatment.Similarly,more precaution works for avoiding the disease like masks towards haze weather or related measures would be in demand.Hence,this tends to boost the development in economy.

Some believe that teenagers should learn art at an early age, while others would say that It is waste of time as well as money. This essay strongly agrees with Children should learn the art field because It increases their creativity and develops their minds. 

The primary reason students learn arts is that It improves their problem-solving skills. This is because If they learn painting and many more arts improve their mental abilities as well as develop their mind as well. For instance, a study conducted by American Management School found that around 60 per cent of teenagers who learn arts they are well performed in maths subjects because of their problem-solving abilities. 

Another reason is that they are more creative than any other children. Arts means creativity and if schools teach artists so, teenagers improve their creativity at an early stage.

119,"Some people believe that the time spent on television, video and computer games can be valuable for children. Others believe this may have negative effects on a child's development. Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.","In recent years, there has been a profound increase in the number of people questioning whether the time children spend on their electronics can be beneficial for their intellectual growth. On the other hand, many people believe that excessive usage of technology can be detrimental. However, critics, myself included, are of strong belief that moderate screen time can be valuable for juveniles.

To begin, there is an argument to be made that the increased time children spend watching television and playing video games can stymie their growth and development in a number of ways. To illustrate this point, kids require a certain amount of physical interaction with other youths of the same age group to acquire a specific level of social skills. For this reason, it is evident that there should be a schedule in place for schoolchildren to obtain interpersonal skills to a certain degree. What is more, unrestrained hours spent on such gadgets can impair their sleep and inevitably, their cognitive functioning. This being the case, it is not unreasonable to assume that the extent to which children spend using electronics can determine the after-effect.

Despite the previously stated argument, there are immense benefits to using screens as a tool for learning in young children. For instance, early reading and promoting family relationships is the cornerstone of healthy brain development. Furthermore, technology offers many applications to foster proper speech through singing and storytelling, as well as providing several platforms for literacy due to the advanced access to electronic books. Moreover, choosing high-quality applications helps kids fully engage in their education. 

To conclude from the aforementioned discussion, while some are under the impression that screens are harmful to juvenile development, others, myself included, would strongly argue that technological resources used for educational purposes are instrumental for learning. From my perspective, a refined timetable for the usage of electronic devices would enhance intellectual growth in today’s youth.","## Task Achievement:

123,"Only 20% of Tech Jobs are Held by Women.
What problems do women face that prevent them from getting these jobs and what must be done to change this situation?","Women are working in all the sectors in today’s era, including the occupations that require technical skill set. Generally, only one-fifth of the women can hold the career in the technical domain/technical domains. The problems faced by females to get employment or be sustained in technical area and its solutions will be discussed in the following text. 

The foremost problem caused by the ladies is the gender discrimination. Inequality due to gender, although illegal, exist prominently in many tech companies and does not allow females to work independently. In addition to this, lack of assistance and understanding is another major issue faced by most of them. The mindset of masculine stereotypes is that the women should do the job like nursing and teaching which suits to their basic nature and do not provide their support for the ones who opt for techy jobs.

A possible solution to this problem would be to erase gender-based attitude from a company’s culture. Reinforcing the healthy attitude towards women by every individual of the company can help to overcome this problem. Secondly, the support of people in woman's life is extremely necessary. Aiding in the form of selecting subjects in school and choosing jobs in the industry should be their own evaluation instead of any forceful decision. For example, a recent report published in the Guardian shows that there has been increase in the 20% of females opting for technical jobs from the last two years.

In conclusion, females can opt for the techie jobs more if gender discrimination has been reduced and encouragement  from the families and coworkers can be enhanced.

124,Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is sometimes believed that housing shortage is only solved by the government. This essay strongly agrees with this suggestion for several reasons.

The first argument given to support my idea is that legal power of the government. This arises from the fact that the government plays an important role in order to ensure a life of their people. Mainly because there are various situation which can not be solved by citizens, and also rules are just given by the government to organise a country. For instance, the government can introduce high taxes of owning properties, so that houses are left for people who have low income.

Another point behind my belief is rules and policies of the government. There are efficent policies introduced by the government to assist residents who have housing problems. For example, introducing an economy rules or policies in companies to make sure that people can have adequate income to cover their life. As a result, the issue of less houses will become better.

125,Some people think that public health of a country can be improved if the government make laws regarding nutritious food but others think that it is the matter of personal choice and personal responsibility,"It is a bitter truth that health is important for every nation, but not acceptable that public health is only the responsibility of the governments. People have different opinion on this concern.This essay will highlight the views of the people and seriousness for it.
Due to the increasing in the population number, health is a big concern and our government is increasing the budget every year for the healthcare, but our healthy index going down largely.For example, Local authorities have organised the camp and doctors have diagnosed properly and provide the medicine accordingly, while patients are not taking it on time as per their guidance then surely it will badly affect the body and become more serious.In such cases, the Administration has done their duty and we can't blame them and it is our fault that we have not accepted it broadly. Is blaming on anyone for solving the issue? The answer is absolutely wrong.
Although, government has been assigned two-third part of their budget for this department. 
On the other hand, People have their opinion that everyone have their understanding of rudimentary things for physical fitness and they will try to do some  regular exercise as well as yoga and various other activities which will help them to make fit.Moreover, taking the nutritions like ample fruits or vegetables which make their bones strong and improve their potential for work.
In conclusion, This is everyone's responsibility not only for the government, but also for the humans.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, teenagers are supported to do the community work in their free time which is made some people think that youngsters should not get a wage from this kind of job. And this might be beneficial for them. From my judging, I believe that people should get paid whatever the job is.

Firstly, doing the community work without pay might teach young adults about sharing and caring but it would be better if they earn what they have done. Some rewards can teach them to know how to manage money as well. Furthermore, this might be the opportunity for them to find their pathway about what to do in the future such as social worker, teacher or career that be relevant.

Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, everybody needs to be paid when it is working. Even it is community work or charity stuff, there is a lot of costs that have been devoted. For instance, they need to give their time to taking care of children with special needs, elders, disabilities or they have spent their time studying about working methods carefully. Obviously, there are expenses for travelling to the workplace.

In conclusion, teenagers who do community work without money returns might get benefits in some way but they can do this kind of effort with the reward and still be heartwarming.

127,"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is believed that enrolling university or college would be the ultimate way to a sucesseful career. However, the apponents to this veiw urgue that working straight after gradauting from high school is far better. In my opinion, I would agree with former view because it secures more job apportunities. 

The greatest advantage of working after the graduation of high school is gaining practical experience. This experience will teach them to become independent and self-reliant through working hard to support themselves and their family. Besides supporting themselves finanically, it would help them to determine which major they want to study if they decided to go to college. To illustarte this, many entry level jobs have taught fresh school graduates important skills, such as time management and team working , which is difficult to learn these skills at university. 

One of the signficiant advantage of studying at university is providing graduates lucrative professional opportunities. They claim students will gain academic qualifications that are required by most of the indusrties. It is impossible to work as doctor, teacher or lawyer if you dont have a university degree. For that reason, choosing this option would help them to build a successful career because they have the chance to effectively progress and stimulate their development. This is resulted in climbing the career ladders to a higher levels, and this could incredablity improve their financial situation.

129,"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","In recent times, it's very important to recycle things like a plastic and glass and reduce the waste of it by teaching children. However, It's a highly debated topic, Some believe that it should be taught by schools and others think that it might be more effective if learn at home by parents. This essay will discuss both points of views further. I firmly believe that, Children should be aware and learn about this at the institution.

On the one hand, some group of people agrees that like other learnings, the value of recycled material and rubbish should teach at the house. In light of the fact that, Child always learns anything first at home to other places. For instance, one research held by the World Health Organisation in 1998 resulted, babies are adopting habits such as eating, drinking, walking, etc. From their parents and guardians while spending time with them. Therefore, they argue that home is a good place to learn about recycling things and waste.

On the other hand, I would stand by the former view that an institution is a more effective place for aware children to grasp habits of reuse the things. Firstly, It's well established fact that, students more listen to their teachers to parents. Secondly, They can learn from other peers by watching them. Last but not the least, If schools provide learning through practical examples, then children can more retain information for a long time. For example, One recent European study demonstrates that, Learning at school is far more impactful than home.

To conclude, People may vary in their opinion, I strongly believe that learning about reducing a waste and recycling a rubbish to children in schools are a more efficient way to home.","**Task Achievement:**

130,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Due to industrialization and advanced technologies, today's factories are able to produce a huge amount of goods. Therefore, producing myriad commodities also means that mankind is damaging the planet. The causes of this issue and feasible solutions will be explained in this essay.

To begin with, producing goods will damage the environment. To explain, factories emit a large sum of Co2 during the fabricating process and, in turn, will have a negative impact on the globe such as global warming and natural disasters. Take China as an example, the world's biggest developing country, which is called the world factory, in this country are located myriad factories so air pollution is a very severe concern. In fact, in several cities in China, the air quality is quite bad and rarely people can see a blue sky. Another cause worth mentioning is deforestation, individuals every day cut down countless trees to produce commodities and furniture.

Moving further, feasible solutions to the problem mentioned above could be the fast switch to renewable energies. To elaborate, if the world's energies come from eco-friendly sources, then producing commodities will not release Co2 anymore. For example, once factories receive energy from renewable ones such as solar, and wind, they will not damage the environment because these energies are eco-friendly. In fact, most developed countries like Europe and America, are setting up some targets to achieve. To be more specific, Their goal is to reach carbon neutrality in the near future.

In conclusion, industrialization is inevitable and irrevocable since human beings every day have to consume large sums of goods to fulfil their needs. However, there are several feasible solutions to solve the pollution problem. Hence, people should make a great effort to strike a balance between these two variables.","**Task Achievement: 8.5**

131,Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people while others believe that the purpose of museum is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion.,"People have different views about the role and function of museums, whether those places should be enjoyable and entertaining or be educational places only. In my personal opinion, museums should be both a place to gain knowledge and enjoyable enough to attract the public’s interest.

On the one hand, operating a museum just for sharing knowledge will not reach its purpose efficiently. Thus, some people suggest making museums create events and plan projects through which visitors can learn about the history and enjoy those activities actively. Average visitors may get bored if they have to read or listen to too much educational content thus, thinking of education through enjoyable events can be more attractive to potential visitors. Consequently, the management team could earn more funds and can invest them in maintaining and expansion of the museum.

On the other hand, some people argue that museums should only focus on their main function, sharing knowledge about historical and cultural things. Visitors should be educated about the things that they did not know previously. Thus, some experienced guides will explain to a group of visitors or offer leaflets and hangouts in which general information about the exhibition is written. In this way, museums can carry out their main task of teaching people about history, culture, and many other knowledgeable things.

In conclusion, it seems to me that a good museum should be able to offer an enjoyable and educational experience so that more visitors will come and learn new things while having fun at the same time.","### Task Achievement:

132,"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession, what factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opnion, should be done about it? 2","A section of University degree holders fails to receive their dream jobs. The foremost reason behind this, to me, is the casual behaviour of most of the higher secondary school students while selecting the subjects. To handle this problem, pupils should analyze their career prospects prior to selecting the subjects.

 As far as underlying factors are concerned, most importantly,  It might be due to unawareness about their natural aptitude for subjects and associated job opportunities in the market. Apart from this, most of the school graduates are teenagers and this is the stage when children are the most adamant. This fact leads to several confusions in their minds.  For instance, taking physics and chemistry just because of peer pressure, will not allow one to compete with his  counterparts. So, as a result of which  many graduates face frustration when they are forced to do work that they do not appreciate. 

With regard to solutions, It is extremely essential that school authorities organize counselling sessions for higher secondary students to make them aware of further career prospects, and also assist them to understand their strong areas. These types of programs provide individuals to opt for appropriate subjects for their tertiary studies. This further helps them to excel in their performances in university. Finally, dedicated university graduates succeed in achieving their chosen profession.

 In conclusion, I would subscribe to the view that an unguided and unassisted way of learning is a major factor towards job frustration, and one of the effective ways out is to avoid this situation is to assist school graduates in setting a clear and achievable goal.","## Task Achievement:

The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I strongly agree that the higher authority people in all nations must educate the mature person and give study allowances similar to the facilities given to the teenagers . The reason, I believe is that adults are experienced to solve difficult problems, knowing to read and write can add to the economy of the country and moreover the violation in the nation will decrease.

To start with, if the authority spends money to educate the  mature adults they can work and earn a livelihood to support their families and indirectly put less burden on the ruler. Moreover, if an adult is not working the government has to pay work allowances to that human sitting at home.without doing any work. To simplify, the same amount can be wisely used by the authorities to educate the grown-up people and let them live a dignified life. This will directly create  a win-win situation for authority and  mature human.

,On the other hand, a mature person is experienced with real-life situations but since they are not able to communicate in writing they fail to achieve a higher promotion in their respective fields. This leads to mental stress and depression. For instance, an adult  who is uneducated will be working under someone all his life though he has a lot of practical knowledge with income.  In addition,educating this  person will not only increase his self-esteem but also confidence.

Lastly, they are difficult to manage in the community as they are more crime oriented to  earn quick  money in the wrong way.The crime rate in the nation increases due to their behaviour and also the safety of other people is jeopardised.Research shows, that provinces whose adults are more educated have less crime rates as compared to the nation having more illiterate ones. However more educated adults, lead to a peaceful country and well flourished.

To wrap up, the education of  mature adults is equally important as that of teenagers. The higher authorities must pay attention to educating the adults and pay for their fees. So that they can live in self-dignity and there is less misconduct and peace of the nation is maintained.","**Task Achievement:**

What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","History plays a great role in terms of enhancing knowledge. In some countries,an increasing number of residents has become curious to know about the history of their homes.Below,the reasons behind this development will be discussed along with some ways through which citizens can research this.

To begin with,there are quite a few reasons for which people feel the necessity to know about the past story of their homes.First of all,humans have the tendency to feel curious about their surroundings and the prime reasoning behind this development might be their nature of feeling curious.To illustrate,when people move into a new house and the house is a century old,they become excited to know about what happened in the past.After learning about the history they share this information with their friends and family,thus it becomes a topic to gossip about for them .Another reason is sometimes people want to sense a connection to their living areas and therefore,they feel interested in this development.For example,in cities,houses and buildings are all quite similar and residents do not feel connected to their homes. That is to say, through this development they try to find a connection so that they feel fulfilled.

In this advanced era,it is quite easy to find out the past stories.For instance, the Internet is a great resource to learn about anything,whether it's the history of the place or about what people assume about that place. Citizens can simply search on the internet and from there they can find tremendous information.Another way to find out is asking in the neighbourhood,the residents who have been living in that area or building for a long time can give so much information about its history.

138,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Teenagers can learn a lot through working in the community in their free time. Many people believe that this can be advantageous to the community and the children because services like picking up garbage and helping elders can teach teenagers to keep the place clean and tidy and respect their elders. I believe, however, that they should be paid for their work and time rather than doing it for free. 

Children do have free time compared to adults. It can motivate them to participate in these activities, utilized time appropriately, and get paid.  In other words, knowing that they will earn through their hard work without even pushing them, they will participate voluntarily. For instance, if a teenager wants to buy pair of sports shoes, he will work in the community and earn that money rather than asking his parents. However, if asked to work for free, they might end up not performing the tasks well. They will find reasons to avoid performing services to the community. When forced to do the job, the outcome might turn out to be poor. For example, when rewarded, the child will be willing to do duty with utmost care. Therefore, it should be compulsory to pay, when they are working in their leisure time.

Due to this people endure many obstacles .So, i intend to explore the source of this problem along with some viable solutions to it .
To regard with some possible factors of this trend. Firstly.In an earlier time , people used to less transpiration services and they covered long and short distance through domestic animals,sometimes by walking as well.Whereas,these days  everyone has their private vehicles and they reliably on it for moving  far-away and nearest destination.Thus ,this practice act as promote traffic level on roads.One further point is that the public transportation systemshipping system is less effective because human beings does not reach at their locations on time as a consequence, they have to use private vehicles which leads to influx . Another reason is behind that many people who travel rural areas to urban areas for obtaining education,work , medical services ,which helps to increase transportation because they also use private vehicles instead of public shipment.
Moving further with possible action in the favour of address this practice. Primary and strong action should be taken by government is that the authorities provide extra and improve public transit facilities in order to reduce private vehicle on the roads along with encourage people use public shipping and spread awareness regarding health issues which may be occurred in the future due to gridlock.

Others say that amount of time spent watching television influences their behavior.,"Nowadays tv plays a major role in our life. It is  considered by  some people that types of a program can affect  kids' behaviour.While others believe that amount of time plays more role in their behaviour.Before arriving at my position both the sides of argument will be analyzed further.

        To begin with,why the  children get attracted by characters.To answer it, kids are unmatured they do not know what is real and what it reel.They think everything is reality which they watch on the tv.For example,The survey revealed by America that after watching the Harry porter every kids get attached by this movie like eating same foods, wearing same cloths as well as dilogue.Another one is, if  pupil watch thriller film on a daily, it can effect on their a daily life.Regarding this they can get more aggressive and rude.For instance,the data was cocluded by London that 70% of  kids are aggressive in recent time because of thriller film.

         On the other hand,some think a time can influenced them.It can effectaffect them  if they watch the tv an unlimited  time it can harm their brain as well as a mental health.To explain it, the kids watch the television for 5 hours without rest they will lost in the reel world  they think they are in the movie.Also, it can damage their eyes and heart.For example,  Cambridge university has found that if children see television for more than five hours,do not behave like normally in such situations.

142,Some believe that people should make efforts to fight climate change while others think it is better to learn to live with it.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The issue of climate change was always debatable and has sparked controversy over the potential impact in recent years. Many people claim that people have more responsibility to fight climate change, while others reject this notion. In my opinion, we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational. 

There are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument. Still, the most predominant one stems from the fact that the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated this. The virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature. As a result, many countries took damaging blows to their economies and the life of their citizens. Furthermore, many prominent business chains do not have to spend significant money on carbon emissions. In that situation, if citizens do not raise their voices against pollution, the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment.

On the other hand, some others believe that global warming is most appealing for economic practices. Poor communities are unable to afford environment-friendly methods of production. For example, from 2020, The tech- giant company Apple did not provide charging adapters with iPhones upon purchase. Because they have avoided mining a significant amount of materials from the earth and conserved copper, zinc, and many metals used for manufacturing a charging adapter, this decision by the technology giant had caused a furore among buyers. Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that people use lots of fossil fuels for their everyday work, detrimental to the environment.

In conclusion, according to the arguments mentioned above, I feel that to save our planet and secure our next generation, scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps to overcome the situation and make the world a better place.","**Task Achievement:**

143,Environmental damage is a problem in most countries. What factors damage the environment and who should take responsibility?,"In today's modern society, environmental pollution is not a new phenomenon, yet it remains the world's greatest problem facing humanity. From my perspective, man's activities through urbanization, industrialization, mining, and exploration are at the forefront of global environmental pollution. And both individuals and communities are responsible for this and they have to take practical actions to solve this pressing issue.   

There are numerous factors attributed to environmental degradation. However, the principal one is the industrial waster discharged from manufacturing. More specifically,     chemical effluents, which are by-product of industries, are discharged into bodies of water without having undergone proper treatment methods, causing water pollution and subcequently harm to aquatic life. Another influence is people's travel needs. The dependence on cars has given rise to major problems, including air pollution, a depletion of natural resources and habitat losses. The overuse of private means of transport can emit an excessive level of fumes and smoke, which make the air quality unpleasant. On top of that, deforestation for agriculture and infrastructure cause ecological imbalance and the extinction of many endangered species.

The responsibility belong to everyone and the companies. In spite of the difficulties, some actions need to be accomplished by both the government and individuals to permanent tackle this issue. On the one hand, it is necessary for individuals to collect and recycle plastic items and use public means of transport instead of private ones. Even the smallest actions can significantly improve living habitats. On the other hand, the government's involvement is therefore vital as they can launch propagation campaigns to heighten social awareness of the importance of the protecting ecosystem or establish more environmental events such as monthly green days. Furthermore, the investigation into sustainable transport and renewable resources should also be implemented by communities. For instance, many developed countries have made a lot of processes in sustainable substances and energy, which helps reduce the rapid climate change and greenhouse effects. 

In conclusion, our environment is badly damaged because of human day-to-day activities and modern lifestyles, and we and the goverment share this responsibility and we need to do something for the sake of the environment and ecosystem such as collecting litter, changing harmful habits or finding out alternative energy.","**Task Achievement:**

Public always curious about their idol's private lives eventhough sometimes their private lives does not affect their work. Personally speaking, as long as they work professionally, their private issues would not be matter. 

Without a doubt personal area is important because I believe every human being have their own secret that they did not want to share. For instance, when the secret come out to public there are some kind of uncomfortable feelings that can affect someone's mental health if they are not ready with the responses. The watcher will have some different views on the issue, some will saying good while others will talking bad.

145,Some people believe that children should learn to paint or draw as a subject in their school curriculum. Others think that it is a waste of time and that there are more important subjects that should be taught. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Children’s education in school has always highly concerned the parents of children. Some parents may hold the opinions that students need to be taught painting and drawing at school, while some other parents believe that it is useless to engage in painting or drawing curricula, as it is a waste of valuable time. Personally, I am for the former perspective and the reasons for it will be given with examples in this essay.

First of all, art classes such as drawing and painting are educational technical curricula that are originated from our lives. Drawing, as an artistic curriculum, imparts sense of aesthetic feeling to the students from a very young age if they start drawing courses from the beginning of school. As the children grow up, they gradually obtain knowledge about art, and at the same time, they might  consider pursuing further as their future career if they have the desires and the talents. In this case, learning how to draw and paint is not just doing a course, it is learning a necessary skill for the students to make a living on in the future.

Secondly, there is no a more important course than any other courses. The reason why children need to attend school is that they need to develop to full scale and develop comprehensively, which means that they should be educated with both academic content and edified with artistic courses. A student without the cultivation of aesthetics and art may influence the development of his or her other filed of study. For example, the student may lack of perspectives or ideas in composing an article when he or she is doing an English assignment. 

To sum up, it is unfounded to say that learn to draw and paint in school is a time-wasting thing for students. I firmly believe that students should be encouraged to get themselves more involved in artistic courses in school, rather than focusing on only a few academic subjects which are more considered compulsory and important at school.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

There are also people who do research to find a  sense of connection. With concrete residential  buildings everywhere, neighbourhoods nowadays  look very alike and, therefore, it is hard for people  to feel something special about where they live.  However, by learning about the buildings that once  stood there and the people who lived in them, for  example, a sense of connection and involvement  may be fostered.  The best way for people to explore, I believe, is to  ask the elderly in their neighbourhood. Many seniors  have lived in the same neighbourhood all their lives.  They have seen it change around them. They have  witnessed people coming and going. Talking to them can definitely help one uncover some  intriguing stories of the place where one lives.

147,"In some cities, public parks and open spaces are changed into gardens where local residents can grow their own fruit and vegetables. Do you think the benefits outweigh the disadvantages?","There is now a proclivity in several cities to convert public places as parks into gardens, supporting the locals to plant fruit and vegetables. From my perspective, the merits are overshadowed by the demerits in this trend.

To commence with, it is true that this change can bring several advantages for residents’ life. First of all, citizens can achieve enormous food resources by growing in open spaces. If all the public space can be utilized for gardening, a huge amount of food sources such as fruits and vegetables can be harvested, serving citizens’ demands. To be more specific, the locals can either consume the food for themself or use it as a source to make a living. The second rationale for this trend is that it can create a much more favourable environment for the community. Granted, gardens can create such a picturesque and fresh view that everyone loves to enjoy it in their neighbourhood. As a positive result, a healthy and clean lifestyle is created in society, making a worth-living space.

In my opinion, I strongly believe that the disadvantages surpass the benefits of this regulation. The reason why I advocate this view is that pulling down parks and other public places can create a society that lacks communal activities. It is acknowledged that destroying open spaces means that residents do not have any area for doing community activities outdoor as exercises, walking or playing team-building games. Given the lack of places for the public, it is much easier to have poor mental health and spiritual life. For instance, kids can easily be stressed or inactive if there are no playgrounds for them to play in. Additionally, there are several places where the locals can create their own gardens instead of parks. Alternative places such as balconies or terraces in the individuals’ houses should be taken into consideration so that citizens can have their personal spaces to grow fruits and vegetables. Hence, the officials can balance demands for parks and gardens at the same time.

In conclusion, both open areas and private gardens bring a plethora of benefits for city dwellers. Thus, solutions and regulations should be taken to serve the community.","**Task Achievement:**

In my opinion, both are important aspects of citizens and the country’s development and equal funds should be allocated to them.

On the one hand, there are certain reasons that the government should spend money on art. To begin with, art is the soul of a nation. This is mainly because future generations need the ancient quintessence and cultural traditions of the country. Thus, the nation's ancient and cultural heritage should have a budget from the government to maintain and preserve it. For example, Hue royal court music, which is known as an intangible cultural heritage recognized by the world, is being invested annually to develop and preserve by the government. Moreover, art is used for recreational purposes. In other words, nowadays, art is a marvellous source of entertainment. For instance, comedy is a kind of art that helps viewers relax and relieve stress. 

On the other hand, it is my firm belief that investing money in education and health is equally necessary. Firstly, health is one of the factors that affect the advancement/development/progress of the economy. Residents can only work effectively if they have good health, which brings a good impact on the economy of the country. For example, in Covid19 pandemic, the Vietnamese government spent a huge amount of money on medical care to buy vaccines for residents. Thanks to that, people could work normally and focus on improving the economy. Secondly, it is believed that education is the backbone of all developments. People with proper education will contribute to the development of the country in terms of economy, science, politics and other aspects. Also, it is evident that most developed countries are countries that focus on education.

In conclusion, to maintain and develop the country, I think the government should not only invest money in the arts but also in education and healthcare.","**Task Achievement:**

149,More and more people are seriously overweight. Some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The downside of modernization and convenience is the increase in unhealthy lifestyles and poor eating habits. That can cause a variety of health issues. Some people suggest that the government should raise the tax on fattening foods in order to address these concerns. However, I disagree with this proposal.

Nowadays, the number of people who are overweight or even obese is on the rise. One of the reasons is supposed to derive from the fattening foods that are commonly known as “fast food,” such as French fries, soft drinks, and hamburgers. Besides, these foods are inexpensive and simple to obtain. They are also well-liked by a large number of consumers. These temptations make them unable to stop buying. As a result, they gain weight. However, the crucial reason for weight problems is unhealthy lifestyles. For example, people tend to spend numerous hours sitting when they use computers or smartphones for work or recreation, which can lead to a sedentary lifestyle. This will facilitate fat accumulation in their bodies, which is a source of different weight-related ailments, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. If they have fast food with a reasonable portion combined with regular exercise, diseases related to weight will be decreased. Furthermore, educating people about a healthy diet and lifestyle through the media or in schools can help to reduce weight problems effectively. With the provided information, they will be aware of the pros and cons of the problem and can choose the best way to deal with it.

Admittedly, increasing taxes on fattening foods can have a certain effect on the buying rate. However, the fast-food industry contributes a large proportion to the revenue and employment of a country. If this industry declines in production, the government may face various negative consequences.

In conclusion, the most effective way to limit weight problems is through a positive lifestyle and a proper perspective on dieting.","### Task Achievement:

150,Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages,"In this contemporary era, the hitches allied to social media are mounting dangerously. controversy exists as to whether social media should be used in order to be in touch with friends and family as well as to be updated with current affairs is beneficial or is an impediment. Although using these applications might have some adverse ramifications, I believe the upside of this trend far outweighs the downside. 

To begin with, there are myriad points to agree with the meritorious side. The first and most prominent one is that these apps have made people's way of communication easy and convenient. To elucidate further, a person can not only communicate with others who live in another corner of the World but also send any news or information within a moment. for instance, by using WhatsApp, a social networking  application, we can send a  message to another portion of the world within 10 nanoseconds. Therefore, it is indisputable that social networks can help us to get the breaking news as well as  contact other people.

On the other hand, are there any drawbacks related to this issue? certainly, there are. The most worrying object is that the masses are getting away from the real world and being involved in the virtual one. To decipher this, populations, nowadays, are quite keen on making friends online rather than in real life. Moreover, they are engaging a huge amount of time on these platforms which is harmful to their study and living style as well. A survey conducted by ILO in the UK in 2015, for example, revealed that on average, 36% of the total population in the UK are a victim of insomnia as a result of overusing Facebook, Whatsapp and Instagram. Hence, the pitfalls of using these platforms are Lucid.

To conclude the main propositions, this critique elucidated the virtues and hiccups of social networking apps. Owing to these stated reasons, I am profoundly convinced that the pros of this phenomenon overshadow the Cons.","**Task Achievement:** 8.5

what extent do you agree or disagree?","Businesses are earning money but they also should follow social resposiblities. I completely agree that business people should have responsibilities towards society well-being.

Nowadays, most of the textile companies are making a lot of money. The bi-products generated by these companies are very harmful for humans so it is the duty of owners to reduce such waste and find a better solution for decomposing waste. For instance, one company situated in Bangalore produced a lot of textile waste which was dumped directly in river. The Government took quick actions and fined the company which led to lesser waste and clean river water. Protecting our environment should be the first most priority for any business companies. Thus, owner's should be held responsible for such things and strict actions should be taken by the government.

On the other hand, companies should not only focus on profit but also on the employees they have.

To deliver the deliverables on time companies are making the employee work day and night. This results in bad health of employees. The people should be treated nicely and work life balance should be maintained. For example, organizing fun activities should be encouraged at work place. It is said that if one keeps their employee's happy then the projects are delivered on time. If the business people are taking care of the folks around them then that company is considered as friendly. Hence, company should be socially responsible because it is beneficial to employee's and company itself.

152,"Many people argue that in order to improve the quality of education, high school students should be encouraged to make comments or even critism of their teachers. Others think it will lead to loss of respects and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","While some adopt the view that students ought to be entitled to comment or even criticize their professor so as to enhance educational quality, others think that respect and discipline loss will be a result of that. I will discuss both sides of the essay before my point is drawn at the end. 

On the one hand, it is generally believed that learners had better be empowered to evaluate their teachers for educational growth. In fact, in  modern days, pupils are inclined to be the centre of the class, which empowers them to raise their voices over their studying issues comprising teachers. If the instructors compelled their learners to follow their path, the youngsters' confidence and creativity would suffer. Thus, it is essential that schoolteachers should encourage children to give feedback, which would help them look back and move forwards. Without such  assessments, the lecturer couldn't internalize new insights from children, contributing to diminishing teaching and learning quality. 

On the other hand, however, there is a widely held view among people that cultural values would be a negative consequence. Having said that, the Asian countries, especially Vietnam, traditionally teaching is considered to be the best career, therefore, it is true that pupils had better listen to and comply with their instructors. Nevertheless, that has not been compatible with  modern educative innovation  these days. If individuals still remained that belief, they would not meet the requirements of the globally general growth, which inspires the youth to debate and express their thoughts freely. 

In conclusion, human beings deem that the young generation should be supported to evaluate their teachers. Meanwhile, others believe that this will mitigate the intrinsically cultural belief. I strongly think that educators had better listen to learners' ideas to have a far superior tendency of their cultivation while students ought to think over before commenting.","### Task Achievement:

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A section of the society believes that in spite of putting a stop to environmental crises, they think to adjust to the change. I unequivocally disagree with such an opinion because it will cause several health issues in people and it will also increase the temperature.

The first reason for my disagreement is that climate emergency will make people ill. It generally occurs due to the toxic gases released in the air such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and helium, breathing such harmful substances makes a person suffer multifarious health issues. Moreover, it decreases the life span of an individual because of not getting sufficient oxygen. For example, a recent article in Times Now revealed that 27 per cent of people leaving in urban areas suffer Lung dysfunction at their early age. 

The further reason is that global warming is a life-threatening problem. The rise in temperature  is a menace to the vegetables growing, as a ,result there will be very little food available for the individuals. Further, the meltdown of glaciers will raise the sea level, and many islands will soon be drowned in water. To illustrate, a survey by the University of Dubai revealed that  95 per cent of the country is dependent on the import of food due to global warming.

In my opinion, this phenomenon is a positive one because it enlightens people with happenings around the globe and at the same time educates the public and provide opportunities such as job offers to them.

This is because apart from television, radio and the internet, newspapers are another effective media platform that carries informative news about current happenings in the local and international scene.

Secondly, people have been educated and enlightened through newspapers.

  One of the most highlighted effects of watching Tv has to do with the enhancement of users' knowledge that will occur in various realms.For instance,not only people's political and social awareness but their biological and even historical information also would soar drastically owing to the professional programmes that are broadcasted.Furthermore,juveniles would be deterred from getting involved with devastating activities.As a vivid case,when they are entertained by controlled media that is released on screens,neither the adequate opportunity nor enough energy would remain for them to allocate to destroying functions,such as delinquency.

157,"men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. for this reason, their jobs are better done by men and other by women.
to what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, much concern has been directed to the differences between males and females. Indeed, these differences lead to sort some jobs, according to gender. It has been stated that men are better to perform specific tasks, while other tasks can be done by the soft gender.  In my opinion, I totally agree that some types of work require a specific gender.

First of all, men's characteristics make them suitable for hard jobs. Physically, a man's body is much stronger than a woman. For example, in the United States of America, around 98% of the construction labourers are male. Such workers can take the difficult job situations.  In addition, the females' ability to work under pressure is less than males. It can be seen that a woman can be stressed because of a small amount of pressure. Meanwhile, males are able to face stress in a better way.

Secondly, a male cannot take much emotional responsibility as a female does. In jobs that require significant emotional aspects, women have proved to be a better fit. For instance, a recent study in Canadian schools shows that the top 20 teachers in Canada are females. A teacher needs to emotionally understand students to help them in the educational process. However, female teachers can easily build a good relationship with students. Thus, women are able to handle jobs that need emotional.

To conclude, hard jobs need a person who is strong both physically and mentally. In contrast, some jobs require someone who has inspiring feelings. Hence, men are better at some jobs, while women are better in other jobs.","## Task Achievement:

158,Some people think that governments should provide assistance for artists of all kinds. Others think this wastes money. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"It is probably right to say that the light on the investment of the government in art activities helps the life of the population rise. The question of whether the manager of regions should be invested in artists. While some argue that it’s not necessary for society. In my opinion, I can only agree partly with the issue. This essay will discuss, and explore more about the above problems.

On the one hand, we will discuss art from a travel perspective. Training of artists to serve for travel has brought plenty of negatives when we use them with effect not high. In fact, there are various regions that want to grow travelling at their local but not tight and correctly managed by the leader of lands. Moreover, in a number of places where the strong point about the development of travelling is so limited, investing in art types and training artists is not necessary. In addition, a multitude of problems need prioritising to solve at locals are not doing, either. For instance,in a number of regions the government has invested in art to advertise travel too much while the people need a lot of help with things like food, education, and health. As a result, it does not have high effects on the economy, wastes, and not help populations, and gains a lot of against from the community.

On the other hand, training the types of art and artists brings a lot of huge benefits when using it the correct way. Standing in the perspective of the leader of provinces, depending on the special of their local, they can give the right viewpoints for their local economy by growing professions and advertising them. This can be seen, in a multitude of places that have special cultural heritage, investing and support by the authority for art types and training artists to advertise them that help their local economy to develop, and it has harvested giant profits. For example, a number of lands have some places recognized as cultural heritage in the world, the government invested in performing arts and it gives a giant profit which helps to solve a couple of urgent issues in society.

In conclusion, it’s not wasted when we develop the art right way and the heart of the issue lies in the perspective of the manager. Besides, the authorities should have suitable and sustainable policies that help the purpose of creating a society better and better.","### Task Achievement: (Band Score: 5)

160,"In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree?","These days, the media intrusion of celebrities’ privacy is becoming more popular in some parts of the world. It is argued by some that famous people have to embrace this trend as a price for their fame. However, in my opinion, I totally disagree with this view on account of some reasons below.

There are many reasons why I strongly believe that it is unjustifiable for the private lives of well-known people to be widely publicized through means of mass media. First of all, the privacy of personal information should be respected as a human right regardless of who they are. Celebrities are also humans, and they should have their own life or their own freedom. Secondly, when the private lives of influential people appear on social media, this can somehow cause some controversy among some groups of people. In fact, some anti-fans or uncivil people can unconsciously post some negative comments which make loyal fans become angry. This would be worse if those people have heated debates and intentional insulation, which leads to utter chaos in society to some extent.

Some people hold an argument that the loss of privacy is an unavoidable part of becoming a famous celebrity. This is because human beings are undoubtedly a curious species, and headlines about well-known stars’ private lives can catch the attention of many viewers, making the publicity of celebrities become greater at the same time. Having said that, I still argue that the personal lives of famous people should not be published in the media due to tremendous negative effects on their mental health. To be more specific, being famous stars can be pressured and stressful since they always have to worry about others’ opinions or be careful in every action when the paparazzi can follow them at any time. For instance, many K-pop stars cannot put up with criticism of Internet users when their private lives are reported on articles, leading them to depression or even suicide.

In conclusion, because of the aforementioned reasons  in terms of human rights and detrimental effects on celebrities’ mental well-being in particular and society in general, I disagree with the view that famous people should accept privacy invasion as a part of their reputation.","### Task Achievement

161,In some countries more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?,"The number of residents who are interested in exploring the past of dwellings they live in is increasing in some regions. In this essay, I will describe the reasons and the way residents find history.

 There are some reasons why the occupants tend to explore the past of their living places. Firstly, people consider that the history of their house is important because the location has been culturally impacted by circumstances and neighbours. To be more specific, residents need to assimilate into that culture once they move to the place. Therefore, they check whether the culture is the one they like. Another reason is that residents prefer to stay in a dwelling that has great stories. For instance, if renowned persons such as presidents' families, leaders for revolution, skilled professors used the residence, dwellers can enjoy by imagining how the notables contributed to nations and became famous.

 Several methods to search histories are available. Nowadays, the internet has a greater impact on searching histories than paper books. As anyone can write articles on the internet without restrictions, it is possible to search both the bright and negative sides of history and reputation about dwellings. Additionally, there is a strong possibility that beneficial stories have been handed down by the local people. 

 In conclusion, some locals are attracted to studying histories around their dwellings because their preferred cultures and respectable histories provide the residents with conformable lives and infinite imagination. In order to explore histories, citizens take advantage of not only the internet but neighbours’ historical stories.","## Task Achievement:

162,"Some people think that the best way to solve global environment problems is to increase the cost of fuel. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The continuous burning of fossil fuels is the major contributor to the environmental problem plaguing mother earth over the last decade. Society feels that the best way to tackle this problem is to increase the cost of fuel. However, I feel that is not the only way to relieve this planet of this problem. I will substantiate my reasoning in the course of this essay.

	First and foremost, increasing fuel costs will create a change in the transportation sector. Many people will choose to take alternate mediums of transport. They will be encouraged to carpool, use public transport and even in the case of short-distance travel, walk or use a bicycle. However, there is still no guarantee for this. For example, in my hometown Trivandrum, the price is currently INR. 104/- per litre, and keeps rising every week. Considering, that travel by car and bike is the easiest mode of transportation because of the distance between the different requirements in the city, and the lack of a reliable public transport system, individuals are still forced to rely on their cars to move from place to place.

	Alternately, what the government needs to do, is to strengthen the public transport sectors, impose heavy fines on the number of vehicles a family can posse, and in addition, they must thrust onto the public fines for using vehicles after a certain hour. Furthermore, they should encourage local bicycle businesses, by creating more bicycle lanes and parks, which will in turn help to boost their business. Car manufacturers, must look into the possibility of producing greener cars, and slowly phase out the production of petrol and diesel vehicles. Once this happens, more and more petrol stations will cater to the new requirements by vehicle owners. These are some of the changes that the administration can enforce.

	In conclusion, I believe the increase in fuel price is not the only answer for this problem, but in fact, the government has to invest heavily in renewable forms of energy if any sustainable and lasting change needs to be made.","### Task Achievement:

163,"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?
Do advantage of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Recently, increasing number of the population have concluded that it is better to have children at advanced age than in the past. This essay will suggest that this is in order to gain financial stability and career advancement. This essay will argue that the these advantages outweigh the primary disadvantage of menopause.

In today's world, it is only paramount to be financially stable. This is because the best of everything comes with a price. Education, which is said to be the key to success, have over the years, become rather too expensive, and have made majority of the people make the decision of being financially stable before raising a family. This is to enable them carter for the kids and provide them with the best there is to offer. For example, a recent survey in Lagos, Nigeria illustrates that 75% of the uneducated adults have poor background. Furthermore, most adults loose their life purpose to parenting as more women transition from working class women to housewives. Consequently, this have informed the decision of attaining a certain level in one's career before deciding to become a parent. For instance, 90% of the working class adults are better parents than the unemployed ones.

Despite these advantages, some people believe that the drawback of menopause should be highly taken into consideration. However, this is not an issue because with the advancement in medical science, women of advanced ages are able to birth children through IVF. The medical records of Ivy hospital is a prime example, they have successfully reported 60 successful cases of invitro fertilization in women aged 40 years and above.

164,"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a
 successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","Education they say is the best legacy anyone can have.Enrolling in a school to get a good degree certificate is sure important as the world is evolving,people that think this way are not wrong. Also acquiring a job after graduating from School is not a bad idea either.

A lot of people pass through School these days but have refused school to pass through them. The essence of going to School is to get a good grade so as to navigate a succesful carrer path in life.Sadly, a lot of students have been forced to go study courses they do jot have intrest in,hence left alone to keep being a boredom person.

Nowadays,it is not even about going to college, when you go to school and you come out being unable to practice what you jave been taught. You practically become a complete vagabond.For example,in my dear country, we have a lot of graduates roaming the street because they  lack exposure and experience.

Also when you keep acquiring various degrees and degrees,you find yourself going to ask for funds from your  guardian or parents. No form of independence of whatsoever.

Going further, getting a job straight after School would avail someone opportunity to be more accustomed to the outside world. People who keep going to School have lesser experience on how to relate outside the four walls of learning place.

Furthermore,getting a job would help the person in question to be able to fend for his or herself financially and instill an high level of responsibility in the fellow.There is a way acquiring a paid employment adjusts your psyche.

165,Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by the artificially intelligent robots? what is your opinion?,"The artificially intelligent robots have been part of the society since it was created and today many of our daily tasks are possible because of it.  Some people argue that this field would overtake all the work done by humans. In my opinion, to an extent, it can be possible, however, there are some jobs that will still use the human labour  rather than using robots. 

To begin with, robots have overtaken many job positions currently. When it comes to companies which produce cars, technology and food, it is pretty likely to see robots in their production lines  performing  most of the duties,  because of the accuracy and  the efficiency that they have. One robot might do several tasks at the same time, whereas one person can possibly do only one task and require more time. Furthermore, the artificially intelligent robots provide various benefits. While employees need to get paid, vacations and insurances, robots will only require installation process and maintenance, which is pretty convenient for the company cost.

However, I believe that there are still some jobs that cannot be done by artificially intelligent robots. Firstly, the medical field is likely to remain requiring doctors. For instance, Although there are some robots that can undertake a surgery, the doctors are still domain most of the medical procedures and researches due to the complexity of the human body and their experience.  Secondly, the jobs regarding with the economy and administration are more likely to require people who can predict future crisis and economical approaches. In my opinion, robots are not prepared to undertake the duties of a project manager or stock analysis yet.  

In conclusion, although robots can be useful in production processes, I believe that some jobs will still remain done by humans. However, there is no doubt that in the future, artificial intelligence  will be a treat for the humanity.","## Task Achievement:

167,Employees should not work in jobs they don’t enjoy.  To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people think that employees need not continue in their current occupations if they do not love what they do. I completely agree with the above statement, and this essay further discusses the reasons for supporting the above statement.

To begin with, Job satisfaction is significantly important and plays a vital role in everyone’s Job. People who work in their desired positions always tend to perform well and achieve not only their goals but also the company's targets, which will eventually lead to an increase in the company’s year-over-year revenue and success. For example, a recent survey was conducted at the University of Waterloo to analyze the percentage of young entrepreneurs in the 21st century. Fortunately, the results were astonishing, and it was found that this generation's youngsters follow their passion by having their own start-ups, instead of working on the jobs that they were not interested in.

Furthermore, employees who perform their duties with dissatisfaction are highly prone to health-related issues. This is due to the fact that work done without interest can cause stress and mental illness, which in turn affects the mental stability of workers on a daily basis. For instance, there was an article written in Times Now magazine about the health topic. It states that, nowadays people who are forcefully working on their jobs without enjoying show an increase in mental health-related issues such as anxiety, depression, and so on.

To summarize, it is very important that employees should take up the jobs which they love. This not only helps the company but also benefits each individual worker. In addition, mental peace and health are more important than performing tasks with dissatisfaction.","**Task Achievement: 7**

168,"The education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However, educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the present competitive era, a large number of  countries consider the importance of  young people education rather than illiterate grownups. On that, they spent huge amounts on the new generation. However, I strongly agree with the requirement of elder people education also having  equal importance to develop the nations. Below I describe  both categories requirements.

The younger generation is the future of  all countries and in this technology developed , the world they have the key role to take up the nations to stand up on the world’s top list. In view of that, Nations are concentrating on allocating hefty budgets to increase their skills and achieve the literacy rate of 100% in the current generation. Moreover, most of the countries providing subsidies on youth education also increase education facilities within the government institutions to improve knowledge rate. In addition to this, so many developing countries have a very high percentile of younger generation comparatively adults.

In my opinion, earlier generation people have  very limited resources in learning and it was so costly for the poverty people. Also, there is a limited interest of the governments to spend the money on education facilities which cause more illiteracy in elder community and also affected to increase poor nations in the world. To counter this situation, they have to learn the new skills and technology, to take up the nation to its heights. Otherwise, this will lead to a gain in  poverty and an increase in unemployment of elder people. In addition to that, there will be a chance of increasing  thefts, crimes on the lack of income resources, this will lead the nation into a crisis and un-stability in the global outlook.

In conclusion, Nations need to understand the country will develop if all the people develop, it is not that one category of people will lead the nation. So their attention should be balanced all groups development simultaneously and according to that nations has to develop their policies on their spending.","**Task Achievement:**

169,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people hold the opinion that asking teenagers to do community work with no salary when they are available could both have a beneficial influence on teenagers and the community. From my perspective, I totally agree with that opinion and I will give several reasons to support it as follows.

There are several reasons why those young generations could receive positive feedback in  community work. Firstly, through a volunteer job, they can enrich their free time which may be wasted on some boring issues as usual, and be more resourceful by cultivating some important or daily skills and gaining valuable experiences. Besides, being a volunteer in  society, their CV tends to be more plentiful instead of sole, prosaic academic grades,  which brings more opportunities to them in university or job enrollment. For example, universities have a higher propensity for candidates with rich experience.

Undoubtedly, the community itself would be benefited from teenagers’unpaid tasks. It is obvious that it can save a lot of money for the expansion is massive to employ paid adult workers. Society can use the money saved to improve citizens life quality through establishing more fundamental facilities and enhancing the environment. What’s more, the relationships of the neighbours tend to be more closer for most of the community issues are very simple and daily works such as newspaper delivery. The community will solve fewer emotional problems due to the curtailing of the distance between residents’ hearts.

170,"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To

what extent do you agree or disagree?","The most effective method to teach a child cooperation is through sports in their learning institution. I strongly agree with this idea because they are opportune to work with different personalities to achieve a specific goal, as well as learn conflict resolution skills.

To begin with, they are actively working to accomplish a task. In games like football along with basketball, each team is composed of more than four players, they each have separate opinions, personalities, and skills while wanting to play the game how each of them best fit. However, when this happens the outcome is often disastrous, for this reason, there has to be a plan, and all teammates stick to following it during the game, only then will they be able to succeed. For instance, when a team of footballers was asked how they had been able to win a majority of their games, they all mentioned the same thing, teamwork! Hence, portraying the importance of sports in fostering cooperation.

 Furthermore, sports play a role in advocating for conflict resolution. With everyone having different ideas together, they are bound to arguments. Nevertheless, these types of situations are able to teach them skills on how to handle misunderstandings effectively. To illustrate, at a younger age, I was part of a sports team where the coach tutored us on how to handle disagreements. Moreover, when an issue arose, we were able to practicalize this which led to quick resolution of any quarrel. This supports the notion that sports is an effective method of teaching children cooperation.

171,Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future society while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society.  Discuss both of view and give your opinion.,"Robots are likely to become more prevalent in people's daily lives just like other technological devices. People have different views about whether this change would be beneficial, or it could impact our lives in a bad way. Personally, I would side with those who believe that robots' role could be detrimental.
 
On the one hand, technological developments, including robots, would make a great contribution to societies. Firstly, they could operate in locations that humans cannot reach or could be dangerous for them. They could be sent to outer space to explore the other planets or could be replace humans to do mining in order to reduce the risk of getting killed or injured for individuals, for example. Secondly, one of the impressive roles that robots play is providing more free time by helping in manual daily works such as washing, cleaning and shopping. Besides, since they do what they are asked to do without any complaint, and are available 24/7, people can spend their spare time on reading or exercising which brings about personal growth.
However, there are several underlying reasons why robots could have adverse effects on our lives in the coming years. Robots could change the workforce's structure. Humans would be replaced by machines which will increase unemployment rate. Subsequently, societies will suffer from poverty and crime. Furthermore, these human-made machines can only do what they are planned to do. As a result, they could make mistakes while working which not only could have negative impacts but also could jeopardize people's lives. For instance, robots are used in hospitals as nurses, which could put individuals' lives in danger by injecting wrong medicine.

172,Some believe that people are naturally born as leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is under question that leadership ability is either innate or nurtured. Some people believe that it is only natural talent while others hold an opposite side that it can be learned. In my opinion, people can develop these skills thanks to learning and working progress and this essay will focus on this issue.
First of all, it is undeniable that there are many children born with superior abilities that can allow them to become talented leaders. Leaders are usually charismatic, confident and persuasive, without these things, it is very difficult to be an inspirational and leading person. For instance, salesman who often fails to persuade customers to sign contracts or make purchases have little chance of becoming a team leader or higher positions. This failure shows that the ability to make others trust and feel convinced of them is very low. 
However, there are many people who have demonstrated that leadership skills are achieved through training and effort. That is why there is a large number of courses are organized to help those who need to improve the skills required to become a successful leader as well as manager. People, especially who are shy and lack convenient, can learn about public speaking instead of good body language, pronunciation and so on and it will make them better leaders. Besides, needed skills such as how to communicate better, persuade others, be more confident and teamwork can also be cultivated and practiced. 
In conclusion, although some of the factors related to leadership such as attraction are innate, human can still try to develop other skills to compensate for our weaknesses. Thereby meeting the requirements to become a great leader.","## Task Achievement:

173,"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. 
 Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children. Some believe schools are the best place for teaching the value of recycling, whereas others consider homes as the best location. This essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that the children should be educated about this important issue at home.

On the one hand, some believe that like most of the other learning, the value of recycling waste should also be taught at home. The process of learning for a toddler begins even before he joins a school. Because, children spend much more time at their homes and tend to follow the habits of their parents, the home is the best place to teach this important value. For instance, it is well known that babies begin to form habits during early childhood. The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home. Therefore, they argue that the education about material recycling should be given at the home.

One the other hand, I would argue that these valuable habits should be inculcated at the school. It is well established that children listen to their teachers more than the parents, and at school they also learn by observing the behaviour of their peers. Schools provide the perfect atmosphere for learning because of a formal and enabling environment. If information about the value of recycling the waste is shared in school along with a practical demonstration, the children are more likely to retain this information and practice this at their homes. For example, a recent Swedish study demonstrated that on average the students retain more information which is taught at school compared to the one provided at home. 

In conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools.","## Task Achievement:

174,Some people say that government should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease. To what extend do you agree or disagree?,"There is no doubt that people’s health will be influenced directly or indirectly by the environment and housing condition. Whether governments should focus more on the environment and the estate has triggered a controversy. I feel that individuals should take more responsibility for their well-being other than government’s increasing attention.

Indeed, the environmental problems and housing conditions are two main sources of illness and diseases. In many large cities, for example, in northern China, hazy weather is becoming a daily killer, especially causing respiratory diseases in winter. Also, the populace will easily access to viruses and bacteria if they live in a poor housing condition without any advanced sanitation. Therefore, governments should give more attention and higher investment in these two areas.

Compared to individuals, governments have more power to arrange a wide range of social resources to address severe issues; however, it does not mean that addressing this problem totally depends on governments. The state is an organizer or a coordinator in our society instead of a responsibility taker. Although governments can claim people to enhance the awareness of environment protection, make policy to strengthen the environment management and invest estate where they need, public health condition is still a personal problem to some degree. For instance, people have the obligation to form and keep healthy and positive lifestyle, or they will still face the threat of illness and diseases even environment and housing condition getting better.

In conclusion, people can also need to take responsibility for their well-being as governments only hold a position as organizer and coordinator. The most feasible solution may be that governments provide a fine setting on one hand and public should pursue a healthy lifestyle for themselves on the other hand.","**Task Achievement:**

175,"Nowadays, more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information,

tasks). Why is this? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","In recent times, many people want their work to be done immediately. I think this is because of the internet, which many people used to do their tasks within minutes. In my opinion, While it has made life easier for many people, others could suffer from chronic illness.

Now, some people are used to the speed; this is due to the existence of the internet in their life. In fact, many governmental institutions migrated to the internet because by doing this, many people can pay online and avoid spending most of their time in long boring queues. As a result, some people tended to do their work with a couple of screen clicks.

On the bright side, doing tasks in no time has made many people feel comfortable. For example, before the invention of the internet, people who were carrying out research had been struggling to find the information. In other words, people instead of spending days at the library trying to get the correct data, it takes a couple of minutes over the internet to find it. Despite finishing work almost immediately has its positives; however, some people suffer from chronic diseases.

By contrast, if many people tried to finish work promptly, they would most likely suffer from stress. As a matter of fact, these people who are trying to deliver their tasks quickly will often negatively affect their health. As a consequence, as long as people are always stressed, they will most probably struggle with chronic diseases such as Hypertension and Diabetes.

To conclude, life has become faster due to the existence of the internet. Personally, I believe that even though this trend has positively affected life as it allows many people to find what they are looking for rapidly, it has some drawbacks because it makes others always stressed, which can result in chronic diseases.","**Task Achievement:**

176,"Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animals species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation.
Discuss both sides and give an opinion.","The rise in human facilities has a detrimental effect on biodiversity. It is thought that some practical actions should be taken to improve the issue while others argue not to. In my point of view, I truly agree that we need to take quick action towards this matter. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will highlight and discuss the reasons behind my view.

To begin with, the main reasons to take a step in helping the environment are to restore the ecosystem and to prevent mass extinctions. To protect the animals’ habitats, human activities such as deforestation, poaching and hunting should be prohibited. For instance, banning these activities will decrease the negative effect on the environment tremendously. Moreover, if we looked after endangered animals, many of them will be saved from being extinct. For illustration, in China, pandas are in danger so the government aid in promoting awareness about them. Thus, success always starts with little steps so we should not give up at all.

However, some believe that it is not logical to pay millions of money to save the ecosystem.  In other words, recently technology is constantly developing and human beings fully depend on it. For example, farmers use more machinery than ever causing soil erosion and resulting in loss of natural habitats. Therefore, the great dependence on technology will irreversibly destroy the flora and fauna species.

In conclusion, human activities have a negative impact on biodiversity but I strongly believe that taking an action as soon as possible will significantly lessen the issue.","## Task Achievement:

177,"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people stored knowledge on the Internet. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?","In the past, various knowledge was stored in books. Nowadays, technology developed so, instead of books we can find more quick and easy much information on the Internet. In my opinions, there are many benefits and disadvantage, therefore, we should use it properly.

Internet data have much fake information, unlike the only right knowledge books. Therefore, we can use the wrong knowledge for assignment, reports. Moreover, we are the cost of buying digital devices to access the Internet. Most digital devices are an expensive option for some whereas books are a cheaper option to get the same knowledge. Also, some people said that books are still safe more than online because the Internet has many viruses.

I think that the data stored on the internet can offer extensive benefits for everyone. Firstly, we quickly find the knowledge on the Internet more than in books, in other words, we do not spend a long time to discover the information. Moreover, the source of knowledge on the Internet is easily accessible from any location and time. Anyone with access to the Internet can quickly access knowledge without geographical constraints.

178,Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Nowadays, increasing the fuel's cost wouldn't be effective to solve environmental issues. Thus, I strongly disagree with this trying of solution. In addition, other reasons are included in this unbalance, such as the deforest, agropecuary, humans, etc.

First of all, even with the war between Russia and Ukraine, people didn't stop buying fuel, but they were complaining about the high prices and still using it. Second of all, the car's engines have been changed to hybrid and electric cars, which helps solving the some of the issues. Said that, would be a good action by the factors to reduce the price of these types of cars. Additionally, more encouragement through the government (Public Policies), business (marketing) to people starting to ride bikes, take the bus, or just walk to their destinations, instead of using the car.

Furthermore, the high demand for meat, eggs and dairy products for humans, have been contributing to increase the deforestation. Thus, with a plain land, the farmers or factories can raise more farmer's animals, like cows, goats, pigs, chicken. These animals also pollute the land, rivers and the air in large scale. In the other hand, another problem starts with the pollution that each person makes everyday by not throwing the trash properly. This action impacts the whole cycle of nature. The system improve an environmental imbalances.

Therefore, changing other sectors of life would help the Mother Nature, it would bring more health to the populations on Earth, and people should have more growth and a wider community.","**Task Achievement:**

179,Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Community work has always been considered as a device to bring social harmony and cohesion among the people who constitute a district or society. Resultantly, it has been advised that teenagers who are the future of our societies should commit a good amount of time to the requisite services of the district for free and to inculcate various important virtues like modesty and humbleness. We shall discuss the benefits of unpaid efforts advised to minors by so many people and how it can also be a quintessential step for a community emotionally and structurally.

To begin with, community work like waste management, sweeping, volunteer work at church, museums, and similar institutions can not only give a glimpse of real-life work to teenagers but  also allows them to interact with people with different skills and from different professions which can act as a guiding force for the youngsters in order to choose their own future paths. If a teenager knows nothing about varied professions, he would not be able to make the best choice the community has to offer.

On the other hand, to sustain a good public structure it is evident that a lot of human force and decisions are required to achieve the goal. However, at times, the cost can be overwhelming for the municipal bodies. Therefore, unpaid and volunteer job from  youngsters can provide monetary elasticity to such regulatory bodies. Also, in the case of an organized and robust volunteer network, state planning can also be strengthened.

Akin to many environmentalists and social heroes who have opined that public service is of utmost importance for the inclusion of members and strong internal bonds in  society, I, as well, strongly believe that youth should endeavour to support their society by doing unpaid services. A neighbourhood is only an extended family and must be treated like one.","## Task Achievement:

180,Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time. Discuss both side of view and give your opinion.,"Following the increase in children's education, parents and teachers argue that the fine craft classes are a crucial lecture or not. Some sets of people disagree that the painting lecture is a waste of both time and money, conversely, others believe the painting will bring various benefits of young children's growth. I personally agree with the latter opinion, and I will write both sides of view.

In the first place, some folks think that teaching painting does not an effective way to all children. For instance, some children are indifferent to drawing or creating something,  educating craft skills should be considered all young kids' personalities and interests. More specifically, a boy who is not interested in technique class, then he hard to focus on the lecture, compared to other pupils who are eager to learn the drawings. Furthermore, some parents who prioritise practical lesson than potential value argue that students should learn mathematics or science than drawings. They believe that Investing money to practical subjects are more valuable than abstract subjects.

On the flip side, some parents and instructors agree with the idea that art is vital to children's development. On top of that, from the perspective of young students, creative activities help to develop their imaginations and creativity. This is because, drawings and creating lead understand another perspective, for example, when give a kid a topic that draw the happiest moments of their parents, the kid will remind his or her memories, and will draw certain moment with imagination. These lectures will help to raise understandings of others'. Secondly, as far as the nature of art is concerned, it leads to express one's thoughts or feedings through artwork. It will help to not mature children, especially, introverted kids who cannot speak their idea without adult's assistants. In this case, teachers or parents will understand more via the kid's artwork, and recognize their feeling than before.

In conclusion, considering the pupil's development stage and a certain exception case, I strongly believe that the creative activities will play a pivotal role at school. The school and government should pay attention children's fine arts education, and spend more budgets.","### Task Achievement: 7
